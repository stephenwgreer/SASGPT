Validate a Decision in the Decision Editor
To validate a decision in the decision editor, open the decision. Then, on the 
Decision Flow  or Decision  tab, click Validate . SAS Intelligent Decisioning 
validates everything that can be determined without executing the decision. The 
following list describes some of the validations that SAS Intelligent Decisioning 
performs:
nThe rule sets that are used in the decision contain no errors, such as missing 
required values or branch values that overlap.
nThe model type of each model that is used in the decision is a supported type , 
and DS2 code can be generated for the model.
nTreatment groups , lookup tables , and global variables  that are used in the 
decision have been activated.
nThe objects that are specified in each of the decision nodes exist, and the 
current user has permission to access the objects.
nObject variables are mapped to decision variables on page 247.
Error messages are shown in the Errors  panel and are categorized by error type. 
For many error types, this panel is updated as you fix the errors. For some errors, 
such as errors in nested decisions or activation errors, you must click Validate  again 
to clear the error message.
TIP If you routinely validate very large decisions, increasing the number of 
threads available to the validation process can improve performance. For 
more information, see the 
sas.decisions.validation.validationCoreThreadPoolSize  configuration option.
If the validation finds errors, you can click Export  in the Errors  panel to export the 
list of errors to a PDF file.
