3Click OK to close the window. The tag remains in the list of previously entered 
tags that is displayed when you add a tag, but the tag is no longer associated 
with version.
Modify a Version Tag
You cannot modify a version tag that already exists. To change the content of an 
existing tag, delete the tag as described in “Remove a Version Tag” on page 186, 
and then add the tag again as described in “Add a Version Tag” on page 186.
Testing Code Files
Ways to Test a Code File
There are two types of tests for code files:
Basic test
executes the code file in the SAS Cloud Analytic Services (CAS) destination 
using the input table that you specify. You can also specify a debugging variable. 
For more information, see “Create and Run a New Test” on page 188.
Scenario test
enables you to enter specific input values and the output values that you expect 
the test to generate. A scenario test identifies differences between the output 
that you expect to see and the actual output that is generated when the test is 
run. You can also compare the test definitions and test results of different 
scenarios. Scenario tests are also run in CAS. For more information, see “Test a 
Scenario” on page 289.
Note: You can create and run basic tests and scenario tests for DS2, SQL, and 
Python custom code files, but you cannot run these tests directly on custom context 
files. You can test the functions that are defined in a custom context file by testing 
the rule set or DS2 file that uses the context functions. Validating a custom context 
file determines whether the file is syntactically correct and whether it includes 
declaration statements for the packages that are used in the file. For more 
information, see “Validate SQL, DS2, or Context Files” on page 175.Testing Code Files 187
