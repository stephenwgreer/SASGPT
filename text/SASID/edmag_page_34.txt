kubectl -n $namespace get service sas-crunchy-data-postgres -o wide
Specify this cluster ID as the host ID in the JDBC URI when you define the spring.datasource.uri 
property in Step 4 .
4In SAS Environment Manager, edit the configuration properties for the database. For more 
information, see “Properties for Third-Party Subject Contacts and Treatment Definition Databases” 
on page 21.
5Shut down the subject contacts service, the treatment definitions service, or both services, 
depending on which databases you are reconfiguring:kubectl scale deployment sas-subject-contacts -n $namespace --replicas=0kubectl scale deployment sas-decisions-definitions -n $namespace --replicas=0
6Start new instances of the services that you shut down in Step 5 :kubectl scale deployment sas-subject-contacts -n $namespace --replicas=1kubectl scale deployment sas-decisions-definitions -n $namespace --replicas=1

Crunchy PostgreSQL Operator .
Delete Third-Party Database Configurations
If a configuration instance is not specified correctly, and the associated services do not start, remove 
all the third-party database configurations.
1Determine the configuration instance IDs for your third-party database.
You might have recorded the configuration instance IDs when you completed Step 4f  in “Third-
Party Database Properties” on page 21.
If you did not record the IDs when you configured the database, you can retrieve the instance IDs 
by completing these steps:
aOn the primary node of the Kubernetes cluster, export the KUBECONFIG environment 
variable, and set the value of the Kubernetes namespace (such as d9997
):export KUBECONFIG=/etc/kubernetes/admin.conf# List all the available namespaces. Find the namespace of the SAS Viya deployment.kubectl get namespace# Set the namespace of the SAS Viya deployment.namespace=k8s_namespace_value
bRun the following commands to export the configuration information to a file such as /tmp/consul.txt
:kubectl -n $namespace exec -i  $(kubectl -n $namespace get pods | grep  sas-consul-server |grep Running|cut -d " " -f 1) -c sas-consul-server -- bash  -s <<< "export CONSUL_HTTP_ADDR=https://localhost:8500; export SSL_CERT_FILE=/opt/sas/viya/config/etc/SASSecurityCertificateFramework/cacerts/trustedcerts.pem; export CONSUL_TOKEN=\$(cat /opt/sas/viya/config/etc/SASSecurityCertificateFramework/tokens/consul/default/client.token); /opt/sas/viya/home/bin/sas-bootstrap-config kv read --recurse config" > /tmp/consul.txt
cDelete the static keys from Consul. Open a UNIX shell on the server where Consul is running, 
and enter the appropriate commands for the database whose configuration you are removing.
To delete the keys for the subject contacts database, enter the following commands:33
