sas.decisions.includeRuleFiredInformationForSubdecisions
specifies whether rule-fired information is recorded for subdecisions when a decision is tested. 
This option must be turned on in order to specify the INCLUDESUBDECISIONRULEFIRE=YES 
option on the %DCM_RULEFIRE_DETAIL macro.DefaultOffTipIf you turn on this option, it is recommended that you re-run any existing tests or scenario 
tests for decisions that contain subdecisions.See“%DCM_RULEFIRE_DETAIL Macro” in SAS Intelligent Decisioning: Macro Guide
sas.decisions.inlineGlobalVariableValues
specifies whether the current values of global variables are included inline in generated code 
when you publish a decision to CAS or to SAS Micro Analytic Service destinations. When this 
property is set to On, the current value of each global variable is included in the code that is 
generated for these destinations. Changes to the values of the variables do not affect published 
decisions. When this property is set to Off, the generated code uses a SAS format or SAS Micro 
Analytic Service module to retrieve the current value of the global variable when the decision is 
run.DefaultOnSee“Activating a Global Variable” in SAS Intelligent Decisioning: User’s Guide
sas.decisions.logicalExpression
Specifies whether SAS Intelligent Decisioning adds the DS2 option LOGICALEXPR= to the code 
that it generates for decisions. The LOGICALEXPR= option specifies how logical AND and OR 
expressions are evaluated. Valid option values are STANDARD and OPTIMIZED.STANDARDspecifies that DS2 can evaluate both operands of a logical AND or OR 
expression before returning a result.OPTIMIZEDspecifies that DS2 optimizes the evaluation of the operands of logical AND and 
OR expressions by returning a result that is based on the first operand when 
possible. Specifying OPTIMIZED can enable the code to run faster and can 
simplify the processing of complex rule conditions.DefaultSTANDARDNoteThis option applies to both published code and test code.See“LOGICALEXPR=STANDARD | OPTIMIZED” in SAS DS2 Language Reference
sas.decisions.masInlineTreatmentGroup
Determines whether the packages for treatment groups that are published to SAS Micro Analytic 
Service destinations are included inline in the published content.DefaultOffSee“Content Executed by Published Decisions” in SAS Intelligent Decisioning: User’s Guide
sas.decisions.messageLimit
Specifies whether SAS Intelligent Decisioning adds the DS2 option MSGLIMIT= to the code that it 
generates for decisions. The MSGLIMIT= option specifies the maximum number of error, warning, 
and note messages that can be written to the SAS log while the code executes.Default1024 10
