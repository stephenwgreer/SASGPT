TIP Except for query files that you edit in SAS Studio, you must check 
out objects that are saved in a folder for which the check-out and commit 
feature is enabled before you can edit them. The check-out and commit 
feature is always enabled for the Decision Repository
 folder. See 
“Checking Out and Committing Decision Versions” on page 272 for more 
information.
9(Optional) If the code file is in a folder for which the check-out and commit 
feature is enabled, click the Versions  tab and check out the latest version of the 
code file. For more information, see “Check Out and Commit a Custom Code 
File Version” on page 184.
TIP  By default, the autocomplete feature is turned on for SAS functions 
and custom functions. You can turn off this feature or change what is 
displayed in the autocomplete list by using the SAS Intelligent Decisioning 
settings. You can specify that SAS Intelligent Decisioning also displays 
variable names. For information, see “SAS Intelligent Decisioning Settings” 
on page 8.
In the autocmplete list, SAS Intelligent Decisioning displays all function 
names and variable names that match the text that you enter. Double-click an 
item to add it to the code field. Single-click an item to display information 
about the item, such as whether it is a function or a variable. For functions, 
the information includes the returned data type and category. For variables, 
the information includes the data type and direction (input, output, or both).
The autocomplete list does not include functions that are defined in a custom 
context file.
