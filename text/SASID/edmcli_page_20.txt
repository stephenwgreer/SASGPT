decisiongitdeploy Plug-In
Enables you to deploy decisions and rule sets from a local Git repository to the SAS Micro Analytic Service 
destination (maslocal) or to a SAS Cloud Analytic Services (CAS) destination.
Requirements: You must create a profile and sign in before you use the CLI. See “Creating and Using 
Profiles” on page 2 for more information.
You must publish the decisions and rule sets to a Git publishing destination. Then, you 
must copy the published objects from the Git publishing destination into your local Git 
repository (by using either the Git clone command or the Git pull command) before you 
use this CLI to deploy the objects.
You must have Read access to the Git repository.
