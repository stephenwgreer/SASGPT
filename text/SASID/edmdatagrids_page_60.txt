variable that evaluates to a column name.
operator
specifies one of the following operators shown in “Comparing Values in Data 
Grids” on page 30. You can specify the name of a character variable that 
evaluates to one of these operators, or you can specify the operator enclosed in 
single quotation marks.
variableOrValue

The DATAGRID_FILTEREDGETINDEX function compares the value in filterColumn 
to the specified variableOrValue  by using the comparison operator. The comparison 
is as follows:filterColumn  operator  variableOrValue
This function returns the row number of the first row for which the comparison 
evaluates to true.
Example
The following example searches for the first row in the DebtEval data grid where the 
value of the riskGroup column is equal to Low
. It returns the row number of the row, 
or if it does not find the value Low
, it returns -1.DATAGRID_FILTEREDGET(DebtEval,'riskGroup','EQ','Low')
