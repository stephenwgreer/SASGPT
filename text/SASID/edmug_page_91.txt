Importing and Exporting Rule Sets
You can import rule sets from and export rule sets to comma-delimited (CSV) files. 
The format of the CSV file is the same format that is used by the 
%DCM_IMPORT_RULESET macro. For more information, see “Format of Rule Set 
CSV Input File” in SAS Intelligent Decisioning: Macro Guide .
IMPORTANT The import and export features in SAS Intelligent Decisioning 
are for modifying an existing rule set. If you do not need to edit content as a 
CSV file, use either the SAS Viya Command-Line (sas-viya) or SAS 
Environment Manager to import and export content. The SAS Viya CLI and 
SAS Environment Manager enable you to import new objects. For information 
about the CLI, see SAS Viya Platform: Content Migration from SAS Viya 4 . 
For information about using SAS Environment Manager, see “Content Page” 
in SAS Environment Manager: User’s Guide  and “Import Page” in SAS 
Environment Manager: User’s Guide .
Import a Rule Set
IMPORTANT If you import rules from a CSV file into a rule set that already 
contains rules, the existing rules are replaced with the rules that are defined 
in the CSV file. To avoid replacing existing rules, create a new empty rule set, 
and then import the contents of the CSV file into the empty rule set. To 
append rules to a rule set, you can export the rule set, add content to the 
CSV file, and then re-import the CSV file.
1Open the rule set into which you want to import new rules.
2Click Import . If the rule set already contains rules, asks you if you want to 
replace the existing rules. 
TIP If you do not have permission to update an object, SAS Intelligent 
Decisioning displays (Read-Only)
 in the title bar next to the object name, 
and the buttons for modifying and saving the object are disabled.
3Click , and select the CSV file that you want to import.
4Select the encoding of the CSV file, and click Import .80Chapter 2 / Working with Rule Sets
