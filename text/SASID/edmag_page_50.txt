Default Permissions
Rule sets, decisions, treatments, treatment groups, lookup tables, and custom code files are stored in 
folders. When these objects are created through the user interface, the default permissions are 
determined by the folder in which the object is stored.
In SAS Environment Manager, each folder is assigned permissions that apply to the folder itself and 
permissions that apply to the objects within the folder. The permissions that apply to the objects within 
the folder are said to be conveyed to those objects within the folder.
Global variables and custom functions are not stored in folders. The default permissions for these 
objects are controlled by authorization rules.
By default, each member of the Authenticated Users group has permission to do the following:
ncreate rule sets, lookup tables, treatments, treatment groups, code files, global variables, custom 
functions, and decisions in their own My Folder
 folder
nin the Decision Repository
 folder, check out and commit objects that they created
ncreate subfolders within the Decision Repository
 folder
nupdate and delete any rule set, lookup table, treatment, treatment group, code file, global variable, 
custom function, or decision that was created in a folder to which the user has conveyed Update 
and Delete access
ndelete a specific version of a rule set, lookup table, treatment, treatment group, global variable, or 
decision if they have Delete permission for the object
nactivate any lookup table, global variable, or treatment group that was created in a folder to which 
the user has conveyed Update access
npublish any rule set, decision, or model to which the user has Read access
nrun a publishing validation test for any rule set, decision, or model that they published
ncreate a test definition, including scenario test definitions, for any rule set or decision to which the 
user has Read access
nupdate or delete the test definition that they created
nrun the test and view the test results for any test definition that they created
nrun a rule-fired analysis or decision-path tracking analysis and view the results for any test that 
they created and executed
Default folders such as a user’s My Folder
 folder or the Decision Repository
 folder are assigned 
permissions so that any subfolders that are created within these folders inherit the permissions of the 
parent folder (unless the parent folder’s permission have been customized). For folder’s that are 
created directly under SAS Content
, you must set permissions in SAS Environment Manager in order 
to enable users to access these folders. See “Folder-Based Permissions” on page 51 for more 
information.
