not defined or are set to False
, add an underscore to the name of each 
input variable. If these options are set to True
, do not add underscores. 
Your administrator can add this property to the supplementalProperties 
section in the sas.microanalyticservice.system
 configuration 
definition in SAS Environment Manager. The default value for these 
options is False
. For additional information, see 
“sas.microanalyticservice.system: supplementalProperties” in SAS Micro 
Analytic Service: Programming and Administration Guide  and 
“sas.decisions.masnode.removeTrailingUnderscoresFromInput” in SAS 
Intelligent Decisioning: Administrator’s Guide .
TIP To specify a missing value for a variable, specify the variable name 
without specifying the value. For example: {"name": "debtinc_"}
3Define the content type and the accept type for the publishing request.
4Specify the module ID of the published decision. You specify this ID as the 
model name when you publish the decision by using the API, or in the 
Published Name  column in the Publish Decisions  window in SAS Intelligent 
Decisioning. This name is also displayed on the History  tab for a decision in 
SAS Intelligent Decisioning.
5Execute the decision by submitting a POST request to /microanalyticScore/modules/module_ID/steps/execute
. 
Each module that is published to SAS Micro Analytic Service contains a step 
named execute
. When you post the request, this execute
 step is executed.
Example Code<< Include the code in "Define Basic Methods and Get an Access Token". >><< That code is required to successfully execute this example.         >># Create the request body. The request body specifies the # input values required by the decision.# Modify these key-value pairs for your decision.# Include underscores if needed.requestBody = '''{"inputs" : [   {"name": "debtinc_", "value" : 37.1136},  {"name": "delinq_", "value" : 0},  {"name": "derog_", "value" : 4},  {"name": "value_", "value" : 60850} ]}
