The following command deploys the decision module named loan_offer1_0 from the 
local Git repository named gitMAS into the SAS Micro Analytic Service destination 
on the target server that is defined in the default profile:sas-viya decisiongitdeploy deploy ../gitMAS/loan_offer1_0
Example 2
The following command deploys the decision module named loan_offer1_0 from the 
local Git repository named gitCAS into the CAS model table named loanDecisions in 
the Public library on the server cas-shared-default:sas-viya decisiongitdeploy deploy --tablename loanDecisions -d CAS ../gitCAS/loan_offer1_0
Example 3
The following command specifies the input directory as you would enter it at a 
Microsoft Windows shell prompt. This command deploys the published rule set 
named masgit_rs_hmeq_value_11feb21 to the SAS Micro Analytic Service 
destination on the target server that is defined in the default profile. If a module of 
the same name already exists on the target server, the CLI overwrites the existing 
module.sas-viya decisiongitdeploy deploy -f true c:\Users\userid\gitMAS\masgit_rs_hmeq_value_11feb21
