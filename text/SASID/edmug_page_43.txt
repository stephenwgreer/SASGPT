Decisioning  executes the action of the last rule that was assigned the IF or ELSE 
operator. If several consecutive rules that are all assigned the OR operator, the 
action is executed as soon as a set of conditions evaluates to true. The conditions 
for the remaining consecutive OR rules are not evaluated.
For example, given the rules in the following figure, REJECT is assigned the value 
of 0 (False) if any of the following conditions are true:
n(VALUE >= 120000 AND CLNO < 15)
n(DEROG <= 1 AND DELINQ = 0)
nYOJ > 15
How Rules Are Evaluated and When Rule-Fired 
Records Are Generated
By default, the condition expressions for all rules in a rule set are evaluated 
sequentially regardless of the results of previous rules. However, in assignment rule 
sets, you can use the ELSE operator, the OR operator, or the RETURN action to 
control whether condition expressions are evaluated. See “Controlling Which 
Conditions Are Evaluated” on page 31 for more information.
If a rule’s condition expressions evaluate to true, the rule is said to have fired. In 
assignment rule sets, SAS Intelligent Decisioning  executes the rule’s action 
expressions.
By default, every time a rule fires, it generates a rule-fired record. You can control 
when rule-fired records are generated by using the Record rule-fired data  check 
boxes. See Step 13  in “Add an IF-THEN or IF-THEN-ELSE Rule to an Assignment 
or Common Rule Set” on page 25.
Note: Stand-alone assignment statements always execute unless a RETURN 
action stops the execution of the rule set before execution reaches the assignment 
statement. Rule-fired data is not generated for standalone assignment statements.
