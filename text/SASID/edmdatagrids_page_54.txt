Details
The Pearson product-moment correlation is a parametric measure of association for 
two variables. It measures both the strength and the direction of a linear 
relationship. If one variable X is an exact linear function of another variable Y, a 
positive relationship exists if the correlation is 1, and a negative relationship exists if 
the correlation is –1. If there is no linear predictability between the two variables, the 
correlation is 0. If the two variables jointly have a normal distribution with a zero 
correlation, the two variables are independent. However, correlation does not imply 
causality because, in some cases, an underlying causal relationship might not exist.
The formula for the Pearson product-moment correlation, denoted by ρxy
, is as 
follows:ρxy=Cov x,y
VxVy=Ex− E xy− E y
Ex− E x2Ey− E y2
