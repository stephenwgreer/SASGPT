Content Executed by Published Decisions
When you execute a published decision, the version of the content that is executed 
depends on the publishing destination.Destination 
TypeContent That Is Executed by Published DecisionsSAS Micro 
Analytic 
ServiceMost of the published decision’s content (the SAS Micro Analytic 
Service module) is locked. Updates to rule sets, models, custom 
functions, or custom code files that are used in the decision do not 
affect the published module.
Treatment groups are embedded in decisions if the 
masInlineTreatmentGroup configuration option is turned on. If this 
option is off, treatment groups are not embedded, and published 
modules use newly activated versions of treatment groups. For more 
information, see “sas.decisions.masInlineTreatmentGroup” in SAS 
Intelligent Decisioning: Administrator’s Guide .
Global variables are not locked. If a new version of a global variable 
is activated, the newly activated version is used by the published 
module.
Lookup tables are embedded in decisions if the lookupStaticBinding 
configuration option is turned on. If this option is off, lookup tables 
are not embedded, and published modules use newly activated 
versions of lookup tables. For more information, see 
“sas.businessrules.lookupStaticBinding” in SAS Intelligent
