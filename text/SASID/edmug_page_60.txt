tabs, such as the Properties , Rule set , and Variables  tabs. On the Versions  tab, a

Create a New Version
Note: For objects that are stored in locations for which the check-out and commit 
feature is enabled, you cannot manually create a new version. The only way to 
create a new version is to check out an existing version and commit a new version. 
For information, see “Check Out and Commit a Rule Set Version” on page 56.
Note: The current version of an object is the version with the highest version 
number. When you create a new version, SAS Intelligent Decisioning  locks the 
current version before it creates the new version.
IMPORTANT You cannot unlock a locked version. You cannot save 
changes to a version that is locked. If you modify a version that is locked and 
click , SAS Intelligent Decisioning  asks you if you want to replace the 
current unlocked version with your edited version.
To manually create a new version:
1On the Versions  tab, click the version number  for the existing version that you 
want to use as the basis for the new version.
2Click New Version . The New Version  window appears.
3Select the version type: Minor  or Major . Version numbers follow the format 
major .minor . If you select Major , the number to the left of the period is 
incremented. If you select Minor , the number to the right of the period is 
incremented.
