IMPORTANT When the decision is published and run in a production 
environment, the decision expects the input data to contain variables that 
have the same name and data type as the decision’s input variables.
Add Missing Variables
If the Create variables automatically in decisions  setting is turned off, SAS 
Intelligent Decisioning  does not automatically add decision variables when you add 
an object to the decision. In these cases, you can use the Add missing variables 
option to define decision variables with the same name and data type as the object’s 
variables and add them to the decision.
1Click  and select Add missing variables . 
2In the Add Missing Variables  window, select the variables that you want to add to 
the decision, and click Add. SAS Intelligent Decisioning  adds the decision 
variables and maps the object’s variables to the decision variables.248 Chapter 8 / Working with Decisions
