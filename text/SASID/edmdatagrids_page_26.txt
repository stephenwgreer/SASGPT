The STDTOGRID output table appears in SAS Studio  as shown in the following 
figure:
The first column in the output table is named ROOT. Subsequent column names 
indicate the names of the JSON data structure and the nesting level. In this 
example, the ROOT column contains the data grid JSON for the name-value pairs 
at the first-level that do not contain any nested name-value pairs: ASSETTYPE and 
ASSETVALUE.[{"metadata":[{"ASSETTYPE":"string"},{"ASSETVALUE":"decimal"}]},{"data":[["Bank Account",47465],["Retirement Fund",3298750],["CASH",163],["Investment Account",2290510]]}]
The DEBTS column contains the JSON for the DEBTS data structure, which 
appears at the same level as ASSETTYPE and ASSETVALUE but contains four 
nested elements. The parent of the DEBTS structure is ROOT.[{"metadata":[{"ORDINAL_ROOT":"decimal"},{"ORDINAL_DEBTS":"decimal"},{"REMAININGDEBT":"decimal"},{"REMAININGPAYMENTS":"decimal"},{"DEBTTYPE":"string"}]},{"data":[[1,1,22144,24,"Boat Loan"],[2,2,715551,84,"Mortgage"],[3,3,15577,67,"Car Loan"],[4,4,230544,45,"Student Loan"]]}]
The DEBTS_BANKERS column contains the data grid JSON for the BANKERS 
data that is nested within the DEBTS data structure.[{"metadata":[{"ORDINAL_DEBTS":"decimal"},{"ORDINAL_BANKERS":"decimal"},{"BANKOFFICER":"string"}]},{"data":[[1,1,"Matt"],[2,2,"Carl"],[3,3,"Ernest"],[4,4,"Randy"]]}]
%DCM_MERGESERIALIZEDGRIDS Macro
Merges tables that contain data grids that have been serialized with the %DCM_SERIALIZEGRIDS macro 
with a table that contains scalar data.
Requirement: If you are working with SAS Cloud Analytic Services (CAS) tables, all of the tables must 
be accessed in the same CAS session.
Note: This macro performs an inner join. If any key column value does not appear in one of the 
data grid tables specified by the GRIDTABLES= option or in the scalar table specified by 
the MERGETABLE= option, then the table rows for that value of the key column are not 
included in the output results table.
