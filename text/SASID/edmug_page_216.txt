Managing the Variables in a Custom 
Function File
The Properties of a VariablePropertyDescriptionNameVariable names must start with a letter or an underscore (_), and they 
can contain only alphanumeric characters and the underscore. 
Variable names can be up to 32 characters long. They must be unique 
within a custom function.
Note: SAS Intelligent Decisioning  does not support double-byte 
character set (DBCS) characters in variable names.
Note: Do not use any of these operators or keywords as variable 
names: AND, OR, IN, NOT, LIKE, TRUE, or FALSE. Do not use _N_ 
or any DS2 reserved word as a variable name. See “Reserved Words 
in the DS2 Language” in SAS DS2 Programmer’s Guide  for 
information about reserved words in the DS2 language.Data typeCustom functions support data grid packages and the DS2 data types 
that are listed in “Data Types for SAS Data Sets” in SAS DS2 
Language Reference .
For Boolean variables, you can select True
 or False
 for the initial 
value. However, SAS Intelligent Decisioning  represents Boolean 
values by using the numbers 1 and 0 in the code that it generates. 
When SAS Intelligent Decisioning  is evaluating Boolean expressions, 
any non-zero number is considered True. When you are entering 
expressions, specify 1
 for True and 0
 for False.
Note: For content that will be published to a SAS Micro Analytic 
Service destination, the values of date and datetime input variables 
must be numeric. They cannot be formatted values such as 18jul2019
. Also, integer variables are converted to decimal variables 
when the content is published.Input  and 
OutputA variable in a custom function signature can be an input variable, an 
output variable, or both.LengthThe maximum length for character variables (outside of a data grid) 
and data grid variables is 10485760 characters. The maximum length 
for character variables within a data grid is 32767 characters.202 Chapter 7 / Using Custom Functions
