You can enter expressions directly into the expression field, or you can use the lists 
of operators, function names, and variable names to add them to the expression.
nTo add a variable, click the Variables  tab, and double-click the variable name.
nTo add a function call, click the Functions  tab, expand the appropriate function 
category, select a function name, and click . The Expression Editor adds a 
basic syntax template for the function to the expression field.
The icon beside each function name indicates the return type of the function. 
Functions that return character data are displayed with the  icon, and functions 
that return numeric data are displayed with the  icon.
nTo invert an entire condition expression, click Invert Condition . SAS Intelligent 
Decisioning  wraps the entire expression in parentheses and adds the keyword NOT
:NOT(condition)
TIP The Invert Condition  button is a toggle. If the entire condition is 
already enclosed in NOT()
, clicking this button removes the keyword NOT 
and the parentheses surrounding the expression. This button does not 
affect NOT conditions that are embedded within the expression. (This 
button is available only if you are editing a condition expression in a rule 
set. It is not available for action expressions or for variable initial values.)
nClick Validate  at any time to check the syntax of the expression that you are 
building.
Note: If you invert the condition and click Validate , the validation process might 
return incorrect results. 
nTo clear the expression field, click Clear .
nTo save the expression, click Save .
IMPORTANT After you save a rule set expression in the Expression 
Editor, the expression field on the Rule Set  tab becomes a read-only field. 
You can edit it only by launching the Expression Editor again.34Chapter 2 / Working with Rule Sets
