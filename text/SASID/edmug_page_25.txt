common rule sets
enable you to share the same rules among different assignment rule sets without 
redefining the rules in each assignment rule set. Common rule sets can contain 
assignment statements, IF-THEN statements, and IF-THEN-ELSE statements 
just like an assignment rule set can. You add common rule sets to assignment 
rule sets. When the assignment rule set executes, the rules in the common rule 
set execute as if they were defined directly in the assignment rule set. Any 
change to a common rule set affects all assignment rule sets that include the 
common rule set.
About Condition and Action Expressions
An assignment rule corresponds to this form:IF condition_expressions THEN action_expressions
For example, suppose you have the following rule:IF customer_debt > customer_assets THEN approval_status = 'Decline'
In this case, customer_debt > customer_assets
 is a condition expression, and approval_status = "Decline"
 is an action expression.
For example, the following figure shows the rule above as it appears in the rule set 
editor:
Note: Filtering rules do not contain action expressions. 
A single assignment rule can contain multiple condition expressions and action 
expressions. Multiple condition expressions within the same rule are joined together 
with the AND operand. For example, suppose you define the following rule in SAS 
Intelligent Decisioning :
SAS Intelligent Decisioning  generates the following rule:IF ((customer_debts > customer_assets) AND (credit_score < 750) AND (isHomeowner = false)) THEN approval_status = 'Decline'
