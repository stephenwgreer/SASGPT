Note: If the copied rule contains functions or complex expressions, the variables 
might not be added to the rule set. Add any variables used in the expression to 
the rule set, and validate the rule set. 
Controlling Which Conditions Are Evaluated
By default, rules are assigned the IF rule operator, which means that the rule’s 
conditions are evaluated regardless of the results of previous rules. In assignment 
rule sets, you can control whether condition expressions are evaluated by using the 
RETURN action, the ELSE operator, or the OR operator.
The RETURN action stops the execution of any remaining rules in a rule set. If you 
are executing a single rule set, execution ends. If you are executing a decision, 
control moves to the next object in the decision. For example, the rule in the 
following figure stops the execution of any remaining rules in the rule set if the value 
of the Order_Quantity variable is missing.
If you set a clause’s operator to ELSE, then the clause’s conditions are evaluated 
only if the previous clause’s conditions evaluated to false. For example, given the 
rule set shown in the following figure, if Order_Quanitity is 9, the condition for the IF 
clause evaluates to false, and the condition for the first ELSE clause evaluates to 
true. Therefore, the action for first ELSE clause is executed, and the condition for 
the last ELSE clause is not evaluated. The value of Offer_Percent is set to 5.
Use the OR operator to execute the same action expression for each of the several 
conditions. If you assign the OR operator to a rule, then you cannot enter an action 
expression for the rule. If any of the OR conditions evaluate to true, SAS Intelligent Defining New Rules in a Rule Set 31
