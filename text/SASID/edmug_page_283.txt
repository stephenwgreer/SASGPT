If you do not make any changes in this list, then the new version of the decision 
Update_credit_history will include the objects that are shown in the list. If 
multiple versions of an object are tagged with the same tag, the wizard includes 
each version in the Node Version and Tag column for that object. In this 
example, both versions 3 and 4 of the subdecision Calc_credit_chgs are tagged 
with APR_rules_chg. By default, the latest version in this list is selected, but you 
can select a different version in the drop-down list. The new version of the 
decision Update_credit_history will use the version that you select.
For the Select_accounts rule set, the wrong version (version 1) of the rule set 
was tagged. Remove the Select_accounts rule set from the list of objects that 
will be updated in the new version of the decision Update_credit_history.
2Select the Select_accounts rule set. Click , and then confirm the deletion.
When you remove an object from the list, the original object that is used in the 
decision is still used in the new version of the decision.
