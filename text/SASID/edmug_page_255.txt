About Range Branches
A Range branch compares the value of the branch expression against one or more 
ranges of values. You can specify range values by using variables or constants. 
This branch has an outgoing path for each range, plus a branch labeled Other  for 
any values that are not included in the branches that you create.
For example, the following branch compares the value of the expression credit-balance
 to three ranges. The first range has no minimum value, so it is treated as if 
the minimum is negative infinity. The third branch has no maximum value, so it is 
treated as if the maximum is positive infinity.Adding Objects to a Decision 239
