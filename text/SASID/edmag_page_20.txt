automatically activated in the target environment when it is imported by using the SAS Viya 
Command-Line (sas-viya)SAS administrative CLI (sas-admin).
IMPORTANT When this option is set to On, you must transfer the treatments that are 
used in the treatment group before you transfer the group. If you do not transfer the 
individual treatments first, attempts to transfer the treatment group will fail when the group 
tries to activate itself. Because you must transfer objects in a specific order, the 
recommended setting is Off.DefaultOffNoteTurning this option on might increase the time required to import content.See“sas.treatmentdefinitions.import.resetActiveVersionOfTreatmentGroupOnImport ” on page
