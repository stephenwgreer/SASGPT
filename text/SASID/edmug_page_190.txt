For SQL query files, SAS Intelligent Decisioning  runs the query in order to verify the 
SAS Micro Analytic Service connection string, scans the SQL statements for syntax 
errors, and looks for references to non-existent tables and columns.
IMPORTANT Do not validate a query that uses dynamic parameters to alter 
data. In order to validate a query, SAS Intelligent Decisioning  generates 
values to use for the query parameters and executes the query. These 
parameter values might not match the values that are passed to the query 
during normal execution and can produce unintended changes in the 
database. For example, data might be deleted that should not be deleted.
If your query does not use dynamic parameters but does alter the data, be 
aware that validating the query will alter the data.
