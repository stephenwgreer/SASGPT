SAS DS2 Programmer’s Guide .
TIP To specify an empty data grid that does not contain data or column 
metadata, use empty brackets ([]). An empty data grid is not considered 
missing. You cannot use the MISSING function to determine whether a data 
grid is missing or empty.
Delete Expressions or ELSE Rules
To delete a condition or action expression, click  for that expression.
To delete an entire ELSE rule, select the rule, right-click on the rule, and select 
Delete the selected object .
Managing Rules
Duplicate a Rule
1Click  for the rule, and select Duplicate rule . The Duplicate Rule  window 
appears.
2Enter a name for the duplicate rule if you do not want to use the default name.
3If you are duplicating a rule that contains an ELSE or OR clause, specify whether 
you want to duplicate only the IF clause or duplicate the entire rule, and click 
Duplicate .
Delete a Rule
1Click  for the rule, and select Delete rule . 
2(Optional) If the rule contains an ELSE or OR clause, SAS Intelligent Decisioning 
prompts whether you want to delete only the IF clause or to delete the entire 
rule. Click Delete All  to delete everything, or click Delete IF  to delete only the IF 
clause. If you select Delete IF , then the ELSE or OR clause becomes an 
assignment statement if it does not have any condition expressions. If it has a 
condition expression, it becomes the new IF rule.Managing Rules 41
