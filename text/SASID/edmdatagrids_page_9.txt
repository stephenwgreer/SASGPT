Working with Data Grids
Data Grids and Publishing Destinations
You can publish rule sets and decisions that use data grids to any destination. 
However, it is unlikely that rule sets or decisions that use data grids can be executed 
successfully on Teradata because of limitations on row sizes.
You must use the %DCM_SERIALIZEGRID macro to serialize your data grid if it is 
used in a rule set or in a decision that will be deployed to Apache Hadoop, Teradata, 
or SAS Cloud Analytic Services (CAS). For more information, see “Serialize and 
Import Data Grids Into a Table Column” on page 4.
Ways to Work with Data Grids
You can work with data grids in two ways:
nUse data grid functions. For more information, see “Using Data Grid Functions” 
on page 9.
nExecute the model, rule set, or subdecision against each row in a data grid by 
selecting Score rows in this data grid  when you map the object’s input 
variables in a decision. For more information, see “Scoring Rows in a Data Grid” 
on page 6.
In custom code files, you use data grid functions to process the data in a data grid. 
For more information, see “Using Data Grids in a Code File” on page 9.
In data query files, you can specify whether the query returns a data grid or a single 
row of scalar variables. You can select what the query returns by specifying the 
output type on the properties panel of the query file after you add the query file to a 
decision. See “Add an Existing Object” in SAS Intelligent Decisioning: User’s Guide
and “Create and Add a New Object” in SAS Intelligent Decisioning: User’s Guide .
Note: You cannot use data grids in branch condition expressions. If you need to 
use a value calculated from a data grid in a branch condition expression, calculate 
the value in a rule set, assign the value to a variable, and then use the variable in a 
subsequent branch condition expression.Working with Data Grids 5
