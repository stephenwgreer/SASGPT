Reloading Lookup Tables When CAS Is 
Restarted
IMPORTANT All the CAS configuration instances are disabled by default, which means that 
processing is not enabled for any modifications to the configuration instances in SAS 
Environment Manager. In order to modify the cas-shared-default configuration instances, a 
Kubernetes administrator must set SAS_ALLOW_ADMIN_SCRIPTS to True in sas-shared-config configMap
. For instructions, see the file $deploy/sas-bases/overlays/sas-programming-environment/README.md
. For more information, see “Edit Server Configuration 
Instances” in SAS Environment Manager: User’s Guide .
Also, you must restart the CAS server after you make changes to the cas-shared-default 
configuration settings.
Whenever SAS Cloud Analytic Services (CAS) is restarted, you must either manually reactivate 
lookup tables, or you must enable them to be reloaded automatically. To enable the lookup tables to 
be reloaded automatically, add the formats library to the formats search path. The name of the 
formats library is specified by the sas.referencedata.casformats.formatsLibrary  configuration property. 
The default formats library is USERFORMATS3. To add the default formats library to the formats
