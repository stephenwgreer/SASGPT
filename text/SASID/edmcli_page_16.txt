Modifying the Mapping File
The mapping file is a JSON file that provides information about exported content 
and any associated objects. The content of the mapping file depends on the content 
that is exported. For example, if you export rule flows, then the mapping file contains 
information about the rule sets that are included in the rule flows and all folders 
where the rule sets and rule flows reside. If you export decisions, the mapping file 
contains information about the models and rule sets that are referenced in the 
decision. (Rule flows are exported as rule sets. Also, in SAS 9.4, decisions are not 
in folders, so the mapping file for decisions does not contain folder information.)
By default, rule flows that are imported as decisions, rule sets, and lookup tables are 
imported into a folder that has the same name as the folder in which it resided in the 
SAS 9.4 environment. To import the content into a different folder, edit the mapping 
file.
You can change some of the information in the mapping file. You can change the target.*
 fields, but do not change the source.*
 fields. For example, you can 
change the folders into which the content is imported and the IDs that are assigned 
to the imported content. The following table lists the fields in the mapping file for 
each object type and specifies whether you can change the field before the content 
is imported.Table 2.1 Fields in the sas-dcmtransfer CLI Mapping File
