About Like Branches
A Like branch compares the value of the branch expression against one or more 
strings by using the LIKE operator. In LIKE expressions, you can use the 
underscore (_) and percent (%) characters as wildcards. For more information, see 
“Using the LIKE Operator” on page 38.
By default, this branch has one outgoing path for each comparison string, plus a 
branch labeled Other  for any values that are not included in the branches that you 
create. You can combine paths by selecting the OR check box.
For example, the following branch compares the last four characters of the variable 
EXPIRATIONDATE to determine whether it ends with the characters “2021” or 
“2022”.240 Chapter 8 / Working with Decisions
