PropertyDescriptionvalues by using the numbers 1 and 0 in the code that it generates. 
When SAS Intelligent Decisioning  is evaluating Boolean expressions, 
any non-zero number is considered True. When you are entering 
expressions, specify 1
 for True and 0
 for False.
Note: For content that will be published to a SAS Micro Analytic 
Service destination, the values of date and datetime input variables 
must be numeric. They cannot be formatted values such as 18jul2019
. Also, integer variables are converted to decimal variables 
when the content is published.Input  and 
OutputA variable can be an input variable, an output variable, both, or neither 
(a temporary variable). See “Input Variables, Output Variables, and 
Temporary Variables” on page 224 for more information.LengthThe length for Boolean and numeric variable types is set 
automatically.
For output-only data grid variables, the length is set to the value that 
you specify.
For output-only character variables in decisions that are published to 
container destinations or to SAS Micro Analytic Service  destinations, 
the length that you specify is ignored unless the 
sas.decisions.variable.length.honorOutputLengthInMAS configuration 
option is turned on. For more information,see 
“sas.decisions.variable.length” in SAS Intelligent Decisioning: 
Administrator’s Guide .
For character variables and data grid variables that are input-only or 
input-output variables, the variableLengthOverridden configuration 
property determines how the length is set. By default, this property is 
set to Off, and the length is set to the length in the input data. When 
the variableLengthOverridden property is set to On, the length of 
input-only and input-output character variables and data grid variables 
is set to the value that you specify. For more information, see 
“sas.decisions.variableLengthOverridden” in SAS Intelligent 
Decisioning: Administrator’s Guide .
The maximum length for character variables (outside of a data grid), 
data grid variables, binary variables, and varying-length binary 
variables is 10485760 characters. The maximum length for character 
variables within a data grid is 32767 characters.Initial valueYou can specify an initial value for all data types except data grid, 
binary, and varying-length binary types. Initial values are used only at 
run time and only for output-only variables.
