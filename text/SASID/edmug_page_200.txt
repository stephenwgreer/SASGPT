Managing Version Tags for Code Files
Add a Version Tag
Version tags enable you to better organize and group your content. Version tags are 
associated with specific versions of an object and not with the entire object. You can 
add the same tag to any version of any object. To add a tag to a code file version:
1On the Versions  tab, position your cursor in the Version Tags  column for the 
version that you want to tag. If the version is not tagged,  appears. If the 
version has at least one tag,  appears.
2Click  to open the New Version Tags  window, or click  to open the Edit 
Version Tags  window.
3For each tag that you want to add, either enter a custom tag or begin typing and 
select a tag from the list of previously entered tags. Press Enter after each tag. 
Tags are limited to 100 characters each and cannot contain the following 
characters: $ ' " # & ? ( ) \ /
TIP All tags that have been previously entered for any object are saved 
in the list that is displayed when you start typing. You cannot delete tags 
from this list.
TIP To filter the version list based on a tag, right-click on the Version 
Tags  column heading, enter a filter string in the Filter  box, and press 
Enter. To clear the filter, delete the string from the Filter  box, and press 
Enter.
4Click Close  to close the window.
