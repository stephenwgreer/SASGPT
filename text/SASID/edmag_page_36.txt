TIP If your subject contacts and treatment definition databases were configured 
together, then these four configuration instances apply to both databases. If your 
databases were configured separately, then you will find four configuration instances for 
each database.
eFor each configuration instance, record the instance ID. In the following example, the ID for the 
sas.datasource.initializer configuration instance is 0b16f426-aaa2-42a8-a0bc-047c69f93cab.configurationservice/configurations/0b16f426-aaa2-42a8-a0bc-047c69f93cab={  "version" : 1,  "id" : "0b16f426-aaa2-42a8-a0bc-047c69f93cab",  "metadata" : {    "isDefault" : false,    "services" : [ "subjectContacts" ],    "mediaType" : "application/vnd.sas.configuration.config.sas.datasource.initializer+json;                  version=1",    "createdBy" : "edmdev",    "modifiedBy" : "edmdev",    "creationTimeStamp" : 1605463464064,    "modifiedTimeStamp" : 1605463464064  },  "enabled" : false}
IMPORTANT Verify that the configuration instance is for the correct media type before 
you proceed.
2Use REST API calls to delete the configuration instances associated with each ID. For example, 
you can use the following CURL command to delete a configuration instance. Substitute the 
appropriate values for your site for the token, host, port, and ID.curl  -header "Authorization: bearer token"  -X DELETE http://host:port/configuration/configurations/ID
3(Optional) Repeat Step 1b  and Step 1d  to verify that the configuration instances have been 
deleted.
4Restart the services (sas-subject-contacts, sas-decisions-definitions, or both) for which you 
deleted the database configuration instances. For more information, see “Managing a Specific 
Server or Service” in SAS Viya Platform: General Management of Servers and Services .
5Delete the temporary file that was created in Step 1b . This file contains sensitive information.rm /tmp/consul.txt
