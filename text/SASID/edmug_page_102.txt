About Channels
Channels are routes by which your company and a subject are in contact. Typical 
channels are email, phone call, and website. A default set of channels is defined in 
the Treatment Channels lookup table. Your administrator can customize this lookup 
table for your enterprise. You can use this lookup table in rules to narrow the list of 
offers to ones that are appropriate for the channel. See “Predefined Lookup Tables” 
on page 116 for more information.
You can create assignment rules to determine the channel through which your 
company and a subject are in contact if the channel was not specified in the original 
request.
