1Uses the subject ID to issue a web service call or to query the company 
database in order to retrieve additional customer data, such as name, address, 
and household income, if such information exists.
2Determines the set of offers for which the subject qualifies.
3Arbitrates the set of offers to determine which ones the subject is most likely to 
respond to.
4Generates a response tracking code and subject contact history data. The 
subject contact history data typically includes the set of offers from step 3.
5Returns to the calling application the response tracking code and the set of 
offers for which the subject qualifies.
At this point, the calling application or a customer service representative can present 
the offers to the customer. The calling application can use the response tracking 
code to update the subject contact history data. For example, it can record which 
treatments are presented to the customer and the subject’s response to the 
treatments.
“Example: A Decision That Includes a Treatment Group” on page 85 shows how to 
accomplish the tasks listed above by using a decision in SAS Intelligent Decisioning .
Example: A Decision That Includes a 
Treatment Group
Figure 3.1  shows a basic decision that defines offers, arbitrates these offers, and 
updates the subject contact history.  This example contains only one treatment group 
and one record contacts node, but decisions can include multiple treatment groups 
and record contacts nodes.Example: A Decision That Includes a Treatment Group 85
