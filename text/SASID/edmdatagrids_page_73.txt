Details
The DATAGRID_LEFTJOIN function performs a left join of two data grids for which 
dataGrid1 .keyColumn1  equals dataGrid2 .keyColumn2  and populates the target data 
grid with the results of the join. The target data grid contains all rows from dataGrid1 
plus the matching rows from dataGrid2 .
When the column names in the two data grids are identical, the columns from the 
left side of the join are added to the resulting data grid.
