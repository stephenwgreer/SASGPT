Example 5: Determine Whether a Subject 
Responded to a Treatment within a Specified Time 
Frame
The presence of a timestamp in the response_dttm column indicates that the 
subject responded to the treatment. The following query determines whether subject 
98 responded to the specified treatment between May 15, 2022 and June 30, 2022.select count(distinct contact_id)from subjectcontacts.dcm_treatment_contacts_vwwhere creation_dttm >='2022-05-15 00:00:00.000' and creation_dttm <= '2022-06-30 23:59:59.999'and subject_id='98' and treatment_ID = 'fcdfabaf-9932-430e-8cf3-149b212881d7'and response_dttm is not null;
Example 6: Determine Whether a Subject 
Responded to a Treatment with a Specific Attribute 
Value within a Specified Time Frame
The following query determines whether subject 98 responded to the specified 
treatment at a price of 100.00 euros between January 1, 2022 and March 15, 2022. 
The price is a dynamic attribute that has been assigned a static value in the 
treatment group, so the query joins the dcm_treatment_contacts_vs view and the 
dcm_trt_dynamic_attr_vw view.select count(distinct contact_id)from subjectcontacts.dcm_treatment_contacts_vw sub,treatmentdefinitions.dcm_trt_dynamic_attr_vw treatwhere creation_dttm >='2022-01-01 00:00:00.000' and creation_dttm <= '2022-03-15 23:59:59.999'and subject_id='98' and treat.treatment_ID = 'fcdfabaf-9932-430e-8cf3-149b212881d7'and attribute_nm='price' and attribute_val='100.00'
