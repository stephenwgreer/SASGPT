Controlling Where Lookup Tables Are Activated And 
How They Are Used
Your administrator can use the following configuration options to control where 
lookup tables are activated and how they are used:
sas.referencedata.activation.destinations = destinations
specifies the SAS Micro Analytic Service publishing destinations in which lookup 
tables are activated. Only one SAS Micro Analytic Service destination is 
supported on localhost
. By default, that destination is named maslocal. For 
more information, see “sas.referencedata.activation.destinations” in SAS 
Intelligent Decisioning: Administrator’s Guide .
sas.referencedata.publish.lookupDisableMasPublish = On | Off
controls whether lookup tables are activated in your SAS Micro Analytic Service 
publishing destination. When this option is set to Off and you activate a lookup 
table, it is activated in this destination. If this option is set to On, then lookup 
tables are not activated in this destination, and your administrator must set the 
sas.businessrules.lookupStaticBinding  option to On in order to embed static 
copies of lookup tables in generated code and ensure that published content 
executes correctly. For more information, see 
“sas.referencedata.publish.lookupDisableMasPublish” in SAS Intelligent 
Decisioning: Administrator’s Guide .
sas.businessrules.lookupStaticBinding = On | Off
controls whether a static copy of the active version of a lookup table is 
embedded in the generated code for an object when that object is published. 
When this option is set to On, a static copy of the active version of any lookup 
table that is used in an object is embedded in the generated code when those 
objects are published. When this option is set to Off, a published object’s use of 
lookup tables depends on the destination to which they were published.
nObjects that are published to SAS Cloud Analytic Services (CAS) and SAS 
Micro Analytic Service destinations use the most recently activated version of 
lookup tables.
nObjects that are published to Teradata and Hadoop destinations cannot use 
lookup tables.
Note: Static versions of lookup tables are automatically embedded in content 
published to container destinations. This option is ignored for container 
destinations.
