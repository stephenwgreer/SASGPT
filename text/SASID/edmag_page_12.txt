RestrictionThis configuration option is valid only when sas.decisions.messageOrder  is set to 
TEMPORAL.See“MSGLIMIT=n | MIN | MAX” in SAS DS2 Language Reference
sas.decisions.messageOrder
Specifies whether SAS Intelligent Decisioning adds the DS2 option MSGORDER= to the code that 
it generates for decisions. The MSGORDER= option specifies whether DS2 writes error, warning, 
and note messages to the SAS log as they are produced or after the code executes. Valid option 
values are STANDARD and TEMPORAL.STANDARDspecifies that DS2 writes the messages after the code executes. PUT 
statement messages precede the diagnostic messages in the log.TEMPORALspecifies that DS2 writes the messages as they are produced. PUT statement 
messages are interspersed with the diagnostic messages in the log.DefaultSTANDARDNoteThis option applies to both published code and test code.See“MSGORDER=STANDARD | TEMPORAL” in SAS DS2 Language Reference
sas.decisions.scond
Specifies whether SAS Intelligent Decisioning adds the DS2 option SCOND= to the code that it 
generates for decisions. The SCOND= option specifies the level of the messages that are 
displayed in the SAS log for the DS2 variable declaration strict mode. This mode requires that 
every variable must be declared in the DS2 program. This option affects basic tests, scenario 
tests, and publishing validation tests for decisions. You can specify the following values:WARNINGwrites warning messages to the SAS log.NONEno messages are written to the SAS log.NOTEwrites notes to the SAS log.ERRORwrites error messages to the SAS log.DefaultWARNINGNoteWhen the decision contains a model, SAS Intelligent Decisioning  sets SCOND=NONE 
before the code for the model package is generated. After the model code is generated, 
SAS Intelligent Decisioning  resets the SCOND= option to the value that is specified by 
this option.See“SCOND” in SAS DS2 Language Reference
sas.decisions.taskExecutor.maxThreadsPerRequest
Specifies the maximum number of threads that can be used by SAS Intelligent Decisioning  to 
generate the DS2 code for a decision.Default4
sas.decisions.taskExecutor.minItemsPerThread
Specifies the minimum number of items that can be processed inside the same thread when SAS 
Intelligent Decisioning  is generating the DS2 code for a decision.Default5 11
