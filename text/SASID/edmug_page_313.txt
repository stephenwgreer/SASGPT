Note: A period (.) indicates a missing value. Boolean values are recorded as 0 
(false) and 1 (true).
For data grid variables, SAS Intelligent Decisioning  creates a log entry for any 
assignment that changes the value of the variable and that is performed by using 
data grid functions or methods. For example, if the generated code uses the SAS 
Micro Analytic Service setValue method to set the value of a cell in a data grid 
named zero_offers_out_grid, the log might include the following entry:Line 556 (package "71a328a8_7336_4c26_70c7_b5901f39d692_credit_card_offers_zero_offers"     line 44):Cell for column index 1 added for DataGrid "zero_offers_out_grid"     with value 8d9bee3d-45f0-4249-b4d7-9aa92b865a92
SAS Intelligent Decisioning  does not write log entries for direct assignments from 
one data grid variable to another such as gridVar1 = gridVar2
.
If the data grid variable is an output variable, the log contains the entire value of the 
variable that is written to the output table. The log entry includes both the column 
metadata and the values for each column. For example, if the decision includes a 
treatment group named tg_hmeq, the decision creates an output data grid variable 
for the treatment group named tg_hmeq_out. In the following log entry, the value of 
the tg_hmeq_out variable was set on line 2847 in the generated code:Line 2847 (thread "56b88b7c_60c8_4c30_c8ec_82ea1b788180_decisionflowthread" line 205): "tg_hmeq_out"=[{"metadata":[{"TREATMENT_DEFINITION_GROUP_ID":"string"},{"TREATMENT_DEFINITION_GROUP_REVISION_ID":"string"},{"TREATMENT_DEFINITION_ID":"string"},{"TREATMENT_DEFINITION_REVISION_ID":"string"},{"TREATMENT_DEFINITION_NAME":"string"},{"CLNO":"decimal"},{"DEBTINC":"decimal"},{"DELINQ":"decimal"},{"DEROG":"decimal"},{"DISCOUNT":"decimal"},{"OFFERCODE":"string"},{"OBJECTNODEID":"string"}]},{"data":[["e4c3c86d-419f-41d8-8e7f-4ba4dfc01f80","2389be10-0445-4647-bc63-0221a078431d","7ab57211-a67a-4e03-adee-dae8436255b5","bbbbe7cd-e11b-49a4-b7f1-afa736503397","hmeq_online_marketing_services",23.2,33,2,234,20,"OMS01","8b758d75-1e60-4787-9e44-3421faf1548e"]]}]

If the 
sas.decisions.nodetraces.includeRuleFiredPathTrackInfoInVariableAssignmentLogging
configuration option is turned on, the log includes rule-fired information and path-
tracking information. However, if this configuration option is turned off, you cannot 
run rule-fired analyses or path-tracking analyses for scenario tests. For more 
information about the configuration option, see “Decisions Service Properties” in 
SAS Intelligent Decisioning: Administrator’s Guide .
After the scenario test has run, select the Generate assignment report  menu 
option to generate a report from the log entries. The application creates the report in 
a text file and adds this text file to the scenario test as a comment with an 
attachment.Testing Decisions 297
