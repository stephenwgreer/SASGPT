TIP This path-tracking analysis uses the data that is in the pathID column in 
the test results output table. To analyze path-tracking data that is in the 
subject contact history, use the %DCM_DECISION_PATH_FREQUENCY, 
%DCM_DECISION_PATH_NODES, and 
%DCM_DECISION_NODES_COUNTS macros. For more information, see 
SAS Intelligent Decisioning: Macro Guide .
