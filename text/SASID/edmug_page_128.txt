Predefined Lookup Tables
SAS Intelligent Decisioning  defines two lookup tables for you:
Treatment Channels
defines several channels for use with treatments. Channels are the route by 
which your company and a subject are in contact. The predefined channels 
include ATM, Agent, Call Center, Mail, Phone, and Web.
Subject Level
defines subject levels for use with treatments. A subject level is the type of 
account that is associated with a subject. For example, a subject might be an 
individual customer, a company account, or a household. The predefined levels 
are Account, Customer, and Household.
Your administrator can modify these tables as described in “Edit Lookup Table 
Entries” on page 120.
