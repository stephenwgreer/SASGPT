Delete Variables
Note: You cannot delete a variable if it is used in the current version of an object. 
You can delete variables from the current version if they are used only in locked 
versions, but those variables are still included in the locked versions.

2Select the check box for the variables that you want to delete, click , and 
select Delete .
Edit Variable Properties
On the Variables  tab, click the Rule Set Variables  subtab, and click on the name of 
the variable that you want to edit. The Edit Variable  window appears. Edit the 
properties as needed, and then click OK.
Note: When you rename a variable, references to that variable within the same 
object change to use the new name. You cannot change the name or data type of a 
variable that is used in locked versions. 
See “The Properties of a Variable” on page 16 for additional information.

can select the column in the Column name  field, and then click Apply . SAS 
Intelligent Decisioning  narrows the search results to only the objects that use the 
data grid with the selected column.Managing the Variables in a Rule Set 23
