Duplicating Rule Sets
About Duplicating Rule Sets in Folders for 
Which the Check-Out and Commit Feature 
Is Enabled
When you duplicate a rule set, SAS Intelligent Decisioning  first creates an empty 
rule set, and then updates the rule set to add the individual rules. The default 
permissions for the Decision Repository enable users to create new objects, but the 
permissions do not include the ability to update the objects. In order to duplicate an 
object that is in the Decision Repository, you must check out the object.
If your site has created additional folders for which the check-out and commit 
feature is enabled, and if those folders have been assigned the same permissions 
as those assigned to the Decision Repository, you must also check out objects in 
those folders before you can duplicate them.
