Importing and Exporting Variables
Import Variables
You can import variables from either comma-delimited (CSV) files or from 
JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) files. These files must conform to formats 
described in Appendix 2, “Import File Formats,” on page 325. These formats are the 
same formats that are created when you export variables.
1Open the rule set into which you want to import variables.
2On the Variables  tab, click Import , and select either Comma-delimited (*.csv) 
or JSON (*.json) . The Import File  window appears.
3Click Browse  and select the file from which you want to import variables. 
4Specify the encoding of the CSV file.
5Select Add variables  to append the variables to the current list of variables, or 
select Replace variables  to replace the current list of variables with the 
imported variables.
TIP To add new columns to an existing data grid variable, select 
Replace variables .
Note: If you replace the list of variables in a rule set and a variable that is used 
in a locked version of the rule set is not included in the import file, you cannot 
save the rule set.
6Click Import , and then click  to import the variables and save the rule set.
Export Variables
1Open the rule set from which you want to export variables.
2On the Rule Set Variables  tab, select the variables that you want to export.
3Click Export , and select the file type to which you want to export the variables. 
The result depends on which browser you are using and the browser’s default 
download actions. The browser might automatically download the file and display 
a notification in the bar at the bottom of the browser window. Alternatively, the 
browser might prompt you to save the file or open it with a specific application.22Chapter 2 / Working with Rule Sets
