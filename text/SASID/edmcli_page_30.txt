IMPORTANT A delay of up to one minute can occur between the time when 
you define or modify (replace) a function and the time when the function is 
available to be executed.
When SAS Intelligent Decisioning generates code, it inserts the custom function 
definition ahead of the code that it generates for the rule set logic or code file logic. 
In the rule set or code file, you can reference custom functions in the same way that 
you reference functions that are provided by SAS.
Examples
The following examples use the default profile. For information about defining and 
specifying a profile, see “Creating and Using Profiles” on page 2.
Example 1
The following command creates the custom function category named Exponential:sas-viya sid-functions categories create "Exponential"
Example 2
The following command adds a description to the existing category Exponential:sas-viya sid-functions categories create --replace --description "Custom exponential functions" "Exponential"
Example 3
The following command adds the function defined in the squareFx.ds2 file to the 
category named Exponential:26Chapter 2 / SAS Intelligent Decisioning CLIs
