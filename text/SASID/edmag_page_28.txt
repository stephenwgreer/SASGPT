Beginning with SAS Intelligent Decisioning 5.5, the schema for the subject contacts database is 
converted to a schema that enables you to partition the database when SAS Intelligent Decisioning is 
installed. The new schema adds a creation_dttm column to the following tables:
ndcm_consideration_treatment
ndcm_custom_treatment
ndcm_object_values
ndcm_object_variables
ndcm_subject_context
When you restart the subject contacts service during deployment, a placeholder value is assigned to 
the creation_dttm cell in all of the existing rows in these tables. After the service has restarted, you 
must set the values in these cells to match the values in the creation_dttm column in either the 
dcm_contact_communication table or the dcm_consideration_treatment table.
IMPORTANT Set the creation_dttm values in the database tables only after you migrate data 
from SAS Intelligent Decisioning 5.4 and earlier to the latest release of SAS Intelligent 
Decisioning. You do not need to repeat this task each time the subject contacts service is 
restarted.
As a Kubernetes cluster administrator, complete the following steps:
1On the primary node of the Kubernetes cluster, export the KUBECONFIG environment variable, 
and set the value of the Kubernetes namespace (such as d9997
):export KUBECONFIG=/etc/kubernetes/admin.confnamespace=k8s_namespace_value
2Obtain the password to the PostgresSQL instance that was installed with SAS Viya:kubectl -n $namespace exec -it $(kubectl get pods -n $namespace |     grep sas-consul-server | cut -f 1 -d ' ') -c sas-consul-server      -- /opt/sas/viya/home/bin/sas-bootstrap-config kv read --recurse config  |     grep '^config/application/sas-crunchy-data-postgres/password'  | cut -f 2 -d '='
3Export the PostgreSQL password to the PGPASSWORD environment variable. Specify the 
password that you obtained in Step 2  in the following command: export PGPASSWORD='password'
4Use psql to connect to the database:kubectl -n $namespace exec -it $(kubectl get pods -n $namespace |     grep sas-crunchy-data-postgres |grep Running|grep -v operator | grep -v stanza |     grep -v backrest | head  -1| cut -d " " -f 1) -c database     -- psql -U dbmsowner SharedServices
5Execute the following SQL statements:update subjectcontacts.dcm_consideration_treatment set creation_dttm = contact.creation_dttm from subjectcontacts.dcm_contact_communication contact where dcm_consideration_treatment.contact_id=contact.contact_id;update subjectcontacts.dcm_custom_treatment set creation_dttm = consider.creation_dttm from subjectcontacts.dcm_consideration_treatment consider where dcm_custom_treatment.consider_id=consider.consider_id;
