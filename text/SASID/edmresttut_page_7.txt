Client ID
Before you use these APIs, your administrator must register a client identifier. You 
must specify this ID to obtain an access token to use with REST API requests. For 
more information, see SAS Viya REST APIs: Authentication to SAS Viya .
Authorization
The REST APIs require authentication for all operations. Authentication is a means 
of verifying the identity of the user or agent that is making the request. 
Authentication is handled with an OAuth2-based service in the SAS Logon 
Manager. You must obtain an access token, and use that token on all requests. The 
example code shown in Chapter 2, “Define Basic Methods and Get an Access 
Token,” on page 5 provides a function for obtaining an access token.
