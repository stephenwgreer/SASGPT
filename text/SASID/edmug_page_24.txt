About Rules and Rule Set Types
A rule specifies conditions to be evaluated, and it can also specify actions to be 
taken if those conditions are satisfied. Rules are grouped together into rule sets. 
Rule sets are logical collections of rules that are grouped together because of 
interactions or dependencies between the rules or because they are processed 
together after they are published.
A rule set can be one of following types:
filtering rule sets
contain rules that correspond to the form:IF condition_expressions
These rules contain only IF statements. They have conditional expressions but 
do not have action expressions. Filtering rule sets enable you to select only 
certain records for processing. Only the records for which the conditions 
evaluate to True are processed by the remaining objects in the decision.
Filtering rule sets are also used as the eligibility rule set in treatments. In a 
treatment, the eligibility rule set defines who is eligible to receive the offer that is 
defined in the treatment.
assignment rule sets
contain rules that correspond to one of the following forms:ASSIGN variable variable_or_valueIF condition_expressions THEN action_expressions
These rules are either assignment statements, IF-THEN statements, or IF-
THEN-ELSE statements. IF-THEN and IF-THEN-ELSE statements have both 
conditional expressions and action expressions.
Assignment statements contain only an action expression. Assignment 
statements always execute unless a RETURN action stops the execution of the 
rule set before execution reaches the assignment statement. See Step 8  of “Add 
an IF-THEN or IF-THEN-ELSE Rule to an Assignment or Common Rule Set” on 
page 25 for information about the RETURN action.
Assignment rule sets can also include common rule sets.About Rules and Rule Set Types 13
