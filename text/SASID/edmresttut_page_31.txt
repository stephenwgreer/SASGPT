TIP The Usage Notes for the Treatment Definitions API  list the members 
of the collection that you use to filter and sort the collection. For additional 
information, see SAS REST APIs: Filtering .
3Use the json.loads
 method to convert the collection to a JSON object. This 
enables you to access the key-value pairs in the JSON by using the key name.
4Define the URL for the treatment group definitions resource and the accept type 
for submitting GET requests to this resource.
5For each treatment group in the collection that was returned in Step 2 , complete 
these steps:
aRetrieve the treatment group ID from the collection returned in Step 2 on 
page 25.
bGet the treatment group definition by submitting a GET request to /treatmentDefinitions/definitionGroups/group-ID
. The response body 
is a byte object that contains the definition of the treatment group. 
cUse the decode()
 method to convert the treatment group definition to a 
string. Specify this string as the requestBody parameter to the POST request 
in Step 5d . 
dLock the current version of the treatment group, and create a new current 
version by submitting a POST request to /treatmentDefinitions/definitionGroups/group-ID/revisions
.
TIP Creating a new version of the treatment group generates a new 
ETag value for the group.
eGet the treatment group definition again, and extract the new ETag value for 
the group from the response header. For information about ETag values, see 
“Updating Objects with the put() Function” on page 5.
fGet the list of revisions for the treatment group by submitting a GET request 
to /treatmentDefinitions/definitionGroups/group-ID/revisions
. 
Specify the following parameters:start=0&limit=100
requests the first 100 revisions. By default, the request returns only 10 
revisions. If your treatment group has more than 10 revisions, specify a 
higher limit.sortBy=sortBy=majorRevision:descending,minorRevision:descending
sorts the list of revisions in descending order by revision numbers. This 
sort order ensures that the query returns the most recently locked version 
as the second item in the list.
gUse the json.loads
 method to convert the response body to a JSON object. 
hRetrieve the ID of the second revision in the list that was returned in Step 5f .
iActivate the revision of the treatment group by submitting a PUT request to /treatmentDefinitions/definitionGroups/group-ID/revisions/
