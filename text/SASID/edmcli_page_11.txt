of the following: decisions

, ruleflows
, or rulesets
. If you do not 
specify any options, the CLI prompts you for the required information.
Note: Beginning with SAS Intelligent Decisioning 5.1, SAS Intelligent 
Decisioning does not support rule flows. You cannot export complex rule flows. 
However, you can export simple rule flows from previous releases of SAS 
Intelligent Decisioning and import them as decisions into the current release. If 
you specify ruleflows
, the rule flows are exported as decisions. If you specify decisions
, information about the rule flows that are referenced in the decision is 
added to the mapping file for the decision.See“Options for the export9x Command” on page 7 “Transfer Content from a SAS 9.4 Environment to a SAS Viya 
Environment” on page 10
