TIP You can click on the values of character variables to display the 
entire value in a separate window. For data grid variables, you can 
choose to view the variable value in three different formats:
nClick the Data Grid  tab to view the data grid value as a table.
nClick the Formatted  tab to view the data grid as a formatted JSON 
character string.
nClick the Plain  tab to view the data grid as an unformatted character 
string.
TIP On the Output  page, click Export  to export the output table as a 
comma-separated values (CSV) file. On the Log page, click  to 
download the log file.
Import Scenario Test Definitions
You can import scenario test values from a comma-delimited (CSV) file. Each line in 
the CSV file is imported as one scenario test. In the CSV file, add a column of 
values for each variable. In the header row, enter the names of the input variables 
and of the output variables with _expected
 appended to the name.
For example, suppose your scenario test has the input variables policyholder
, cscore
, and claims
, and it has the output variables eligible
 and policies
. An 
import file for this test might appear in a spreadsheet application as shown in the 
following figure.
The policies output variable in this example is a data grid variable. To enter values 
for data grid variables, use the JSON string format described in “Introduction to Data 
Grids” in SAS Intelligent Decisioning: Using Data Grids .
The format for date and datetime variables depends on your locale. Use the same 
format that is created by the date and datetime pickers when you click  or  to 
enter initial values for custom variables on the Variables  tab.
To import scenario test definitions:
1On the Scoring  tab, click the Scenarios  subtab, and then click Import 
Scenarios . The Import Scenarios  window appears.
2In the Import from  field, click  and select the CSV file that contains the 
scenario test values.
Note: The import file is limited to 10 MB.Testing Rule Sets 69
