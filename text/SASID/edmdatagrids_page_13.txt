Using Data Grid Functions
For objects that iterate over a data grid, you do not need to use data grid functions. 
For more information, see “Ways to Work with Data Grids” on page 5 and “Scoring 
Rows in a Data Grid” on page 6.
In all other cases, you must use SAS Intelligent Decisioning  data grid functions to 
process data grid variables. SAS Intelligent Decisioning  supplies several functions 
for use with data grids. These functions are described in “Data Grid Functions” on 
page 29.
Using Data Grids in a Code File
You can create a local data grid variable in a custom DS2 code file. However, the 
column metadata for the local data grid variable in the DS2 code is not passed to 
the corresponding decision data grid variable. In this case, you must edit the 
metadata for the decision variable and add the columns. For instructions, see “Add 
Columns to a Data Grid” on page 7.
You can create custom DS2 code files that process the values in a data grid and 
include the code file in a decision. For example, the following DS2 code uses the 
DATAGRID_COUNT function to determine how many rows are in the data grid, then 
loops through the data grid to process each row. It uses the DATAGRID_GET 
function to retrieve the values for the data grid variables. The values of the data grid 
variables are passed to the assessLoanRequest method./* Use the DATAGRID_COUNT function to determine the *//* number of rows that are in the data grid.        */"numRows" = DATAGRID_COUNT("loanrequests");if "numRows" > 0 then do;   do "loopIndex" = 1 to "numRows";      /* Use the DATAGRID_GET function to retrieve the values    */      /* in the data grid. The assessLoanRequest method invokes  */      /* a published rule set to evaluate each loan request.    */          assessLoanRequest(DATAGRID_GET("loanrequests",'annualSalary',loopIndex),                        DATAGRID_GET("loanrequests",'incomeThreshhold',loopIndex));           /* Continue processing the data. */
