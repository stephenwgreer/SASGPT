PropertyDescriptionVariable names can be up to 32 characters long. They must be unique 
within a code file.
Note: SAS Intelligent Decisioning  does not support double-byte 
character set (DBCS) characters in variable names.
Note: Do not use any of these operators or keywords as variable 
names: AND, OR, IN, NOT, LIKE, TRUE, or FALSE. Do not use _N_ 
or any DS2 reserved word as a variable name. See “Reserved Words 
in the DS2 Language” in SAS DS2 Programmer’s Guide  for 
information about reserved words in the DS2 language.Data typeCode files in SAS Intelligent Decisioning  support the following data 
types: Boolean, character, data grid, date, datetime, decimal, and 
integer.
For Boolean variables, you can select True
 or False
 for the initial 
value. However, SAS Intelligent Decisioning  represents Boolean 
values by using the numbers 1 and 0 in the code that it generates. 
When SAS Intelligent Decisioning  is evaluating Boolean expressions, 
any non-zero number is considered True. When you are entering 
expressions, specify 1
 for True and 0
 for False.
Note: For content that will be published to a SAS Micro Analytic 
Service destination, the values of date and datetime input variables 
must be numeric. They cannot be formatted values such as 18jul2019
. Also, integer variables are converted to decimal variables 
when the content is published.Input  and 
OutputA variable in a DS2 code file can be an input variable, an output 
variable, or both. A variable in a Python code file can be an input 
variable or an output variable, but not both. See “Input Variables and 
Output Variables” on page 170 for more information.LengthThe length for Boolean and numeric variable types is set 
automatically.
For output-only data grid variables, the length is set to the value that 
you specify.
For output-only character variables in decisions that are published to 
container destinations or to SAS Micro Analytic Service  destinations, 
the length that you specify is ignored unless the 
sas.decisions.variable.length.honorOutputLengthInMAS configuration 
option is turned on. For more information,see 
“sas.decisions.variable.length” in SAS Intelligent Decisioning: 
Administrator’s Guide .
For character variables and data grid variables that are input-only or 
input-output variables, the variableLengthOverridden configuration 
property determines how the length is set. By default, this property is 
set to Off, and the length is set to the length in the input data. When 
the variableLengthOverridden property is set to On, the length of 
input-only and input-output character variables and data grid variables 
is set to the value that you specify. For more information, see 
“sas.decisions.variableLengthOverridden” in SAS Intelligent
