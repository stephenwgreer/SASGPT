Testing Rule Sets
Ways to Test a Rule Set
There are three types of tests:
Basic test
executes the rule set in the SAS Cloud Analytic Services (CAS) destination using 
the input table that you specify. You can also specify a debugging variable. For 
more information, see “Create and Run a New Test” on page 63.
Scenario test
enables you to enter specific input values and the output values that you expect 
the test to generate. A scenario test identifies differences between the output 
that you expect to see and the actual output that is generated when the test is 
run. You can also compare the test definitions and test results of different 
scenarios. Scenario tests are also run in CAS. For more information, see “Test a 
Scenario” on page 289.
Publishing validation test
executes the rule set in a publishing destination using the input table that you 
specify. When you publish the rule set, a validation test is automatically defined 
for that rule set in that destination. For more information, see “Validate a 
Published Rule Set” on page 73.

Create and Run a New Test
Testing a rule set is optional, but doing so is a best practice. Testing enables you to 
discover any problems before the rule set is published and incorporated into a 
production system.
IMPORTANT If you are a testing rule set that uses functions that are 
defined in a custom context file, verify that the context file is specified in the 
Test custom context  field on the Properties  tab before running the test.
If you are testing a rule set that uses a lookup table and both the rule set and 
the lookup table are checked out, the rule set test uses the checked-out 
version of the lookup table. If the lookup table is not checked out, the test 
uses the activated version of the lookup table.Testing Rule Sets 63
