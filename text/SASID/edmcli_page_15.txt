export_report.json
This file contains any messages that were generated when the content was 
exported.
You can use the --content
, --mappings
, and --report
 options to change these 
filenames.
7Import the content into the SAS Viya environment:sas-viya dcmtransfer import9x object-type <import-options>
By default, the import9x
 command looks for a file named contents.json that 
contains the content that was exported from SAS 9.4, and a file named 
mappings.json that describes the relationship between the exported content and 
any associated objects. If you specified the --content
 or --mappings
 options on 
the export9x
 command in Step 6 on page 10, then specify the same options on 
the import9x
 command.
Note: When you view imported content in SAS Intelligent Decisioning , any 
errors in the content are marked with the error icon .
