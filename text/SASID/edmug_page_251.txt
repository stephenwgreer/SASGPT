Adding Branches to a Decision
Overview of Branches
Branches enable you to add conditional logic to a decision. Depending on the 
branch type, a branch can have multiple outgoing paths. You can add four types of 
branches to a decision:
n“About Yes/No Branches” on page 236
n“About Equals Branches” on page 238
n“About Range Branches” on page 239
n“About Like Branches” on page 240
The conditions for the branch paths are evaluated in the order in which you specify 
them. The first path whose condition evaluates to True is taken by the executing 
decision. The conditions for the remaining branches are not evaluated.
You can change the labels used for branch paths in Equals, Range, and Like 
branches. For more information, see “Customize Branch Path Labels” on page 243.Adding Objects to a Decision 235
