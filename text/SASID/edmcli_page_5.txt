About the SAS Intelligent Decisioning 
CLIs
In SAS Viya, a command-line interface (CLI) is a user interface to the SAS Viya 
REST services. In this interface, you enter commands on a command line and 
receive a response back from the system. You can use a CLI to interact directly with 
SAS Viya programmatically without a GUI. For information about all of the CLIs that 
are provided with SAS Viya, see “Command-Line Interface: Overview” in SAS Viya: 
Using the Command-Line Interface .
The following SAS Intelligent Decisioning CLIs are available:
dcmtransfer
enables you to transfer rule sets, rule flows, lookup tables, and decisions from a 
SAS 9.4 environment to a SAS Viya environment.
decisiongitdeploy
enables you to deploy decisions and rule sets from a local Git repository to a 
SAS Micro Analytic Service environment or to a SAS Cloud Analytic Services 
(CAS) environment. You must publish the decisions and rule sets to a Git 
publishing destination and copy them into your local Git repository before you 
use the CLI.
rtdmobjectmigration
imports objects that were exported from SAS Real-Time Decision Manager on 
SAS 9.4. Currently, the only supported object type is treatments.1
