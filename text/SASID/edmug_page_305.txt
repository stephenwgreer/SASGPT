Note: Value tracing increases the amount of code that is generated for a decision 
and the time required to execute the decision. The magnitude of the increases 
depend on the number of variables and complexity of the decision.

IMPORTANT If you are testing a decision that uses functions that are 
defined in a custom context file, verify that the context file is specified in the 
Custom context  field on the Properties  before running the test.
If you are testing a decision that uses treatment groups and both the decision 
and the treatment group are checked out, the test uses the checked-out 
version of the treatment group. If the treatment group is not checked out, the 
test uses the activated version of the treatment group.
If the decision uses a rule set that uses a lookup table and all three objects 
(the decision, the treatment group, and the lookup table) are checked out, the Testing Decisions 289
