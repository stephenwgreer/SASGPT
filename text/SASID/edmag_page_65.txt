Managing Test Data
When you run a rule set, model, or decision test, several files are created. The URI to the test 
definition and all of the test results are displayed on the Test Results  page.
By default, when you re-run an existing test, the previous test results are not deleted before the new 
results are generated. This behavior is controlled by the deleteExecutions
 configuration property. To 
automatically delete test results when a test is re-run, set the deleteExecutions
 configuration 
property to True. See “Score Execution Service Properties” on page 17 for more information.
When a test definition is deleted, the associated test results are normally deleted. However, the 
deletion transaction might be interrupted or the user might not have permission to delete output tables 
on CAS. To delete results files such as log files, code files, and CAS tables that are not deleted when 
the associated test is deleted, use the sas-scoreexecution-cli
 command-line interface. See 
“scoreexecution Plug-In” in SAS Intelligent Decisioning: Command-Line Interfaces  for more 
information.64
