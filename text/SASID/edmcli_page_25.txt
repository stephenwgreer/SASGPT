output file that this utility creates is the input file for this CLI. For instructions, see 
“Transfer Treatments from SAS 9.4 to SAS Viya” in SAS Intelligent Decisioning: 
Administrator’s Guide .
2Log on to the machine where SAS Viya is running. For example, on Linux 
systems, you can use the ssh
 command:ssh -y machine-name
3Use the cd
 command to change to the directory where you downloaded the plug-
in files.
4Create a default profile if you have not already done so:sas-viya profile init
The CLI prompts you for the target URL (service endpoint) where SAS Viya is 
running, for the output type that you want, and whether you want to enable color 
output. The target URL is the destination to which you want to import the objects. 
For more information, see “Creating and Using Profiles” on page 2.
5Log on to the SAS Viya environment:sas-viya auth login
The CLI prompts you for the user ID and password for the SAS Viya 
environment.
6Import the objects into the SAS Viya environment:sas-viya rtdmobjectmigration start--input sasmaextract-output-file --folder folder-GUID--type treatment
If an object of the same name as the object in the extract file already exists in the 
destination folder, the CLI does not import the object.
The CLI displays the results of the import process. For example:Total objects migrated: 6Succeeded: 5Failed: 0Completed with errors: 0Skipped due to name conflict: 1
Note: When you view imported content in SAS Intelligent Decisioning, any 
errors in the content are marked with the error icon .
7Log off from the SAS Viya environment:sas-viya auth logout
