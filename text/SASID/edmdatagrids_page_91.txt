RestrictionYou can specify either the criteria_dataGrid  argument or the 
filterColumn , operator , and varOrValue  arguments. For more 
information, see, “Details” on page 85.
target_dataGrid
specifies the name of the target data grid. This argument must be a variable of 
type DATAGRID. Any existing data in the target data grid is overwritten.
Details
The DATAGRID_SUBSETBYVALUE function uses the comparison criteria that you 
specify to subset the data in the source data grid. You can specify the comparison 
criteria in one of two ways:
nUse the filterColumn , operator , and variableOrValue  arguments to filter the 
source data grid based on the values in a single column. For an example, see 
“Example 1: Subset Based on a Single Column” on page 85.
nUse the criteria_dataGrid  argument to filter the source data grid based on the 
values of more than one column. The criteria data grid must contain only the 
three columns that specify the filter criteria. The content of these columns is the 
same content that you would specify for the filterColumn , operator , and 
variableOrValue  columns. See the description of these arguments in “Required 
Arguments” . 
The metadata for this data grid could be defined as follows:[{"metadata":[{"filterCol":"string"},{"op":"string"},{"value":"string"}]
For an example, see “Example 2: Subset Based on Multiple Columns” on page 
85.
This function populates the target data grid with all of the rows for which the 
comparison evaluates to true.
Examples
Example 1: Subset Based on a Single Column
The following example populates the CUST5 data grid variable with the subset of 
records from the CUSTOMERS data grid for which the income > 50000
 comparison 
is true:DATAGRID_SUBSETBYVALUE(customers,income,'gt','50000',cust5)
Example 2: Subset Based on Multiple Columns
The following example populates the CUST5 data grid variable with the subset of 
records from the CUSTOMERS data grid for which both of the comparisons income > 50000
 and loanAmt < equity
 evaluate to true:DATAGRID_SUBSETBYVALUE(customers, subCriteria, cust5)
