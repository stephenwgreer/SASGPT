Activate a Lookup Table
Activating a lookup table locks it. If you activate the only unlocked version of a 
lookup table, SAS Intelligent Decisioning  automatically creates a new unlocked 
version.
You cannot activate a lookup table that has been checked out. You must commit the 
changes to the lookup table before you can activate it.
To activate the latest version of a lookup table that is not in a folder for which the 
check-out feature has been enabled, open the lookup table, and click Activate  at 
the top of the window.
To activate a specific version of the lookup table, or to activate a lookup table that is 
in a folder for which the check-out feature is enabled, you must activate the lookup 
table on the Versions  tab:
1Open the lookup table that you want to activate.
TIP If you do not have permission to update an object, SAS Intelligent 
Decisioning displays (Read-Only)
 in the title bar next to the object name, 
and the buttons for modifying and saving the object are disabled.
2On the Versions  tab, select the version that you want to activate, and click Set 
Version  to set it as the displayed version. See “Set the Displayed Version” on 
page 125 for more information.
3Click Activate .
