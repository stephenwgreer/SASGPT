Searching for Objects in a Decision 
Diagram
Use the Search field and the object type drop-down list on the Decision Flow  tab to 
search for specific objects or object types in decision diagrams. To search for a 
specific object, enter the object name in the Search field. To search for object types, 
select the object type from the drop-down list. Use both fields to narrow the search. 
For example, to search for all objects with the name “MSRP > price”, enter the 
following criteria:
For any object that matches the search criteria, SAS Intelligent Decisioning 
highlights the object node with a thicker, darker outline.

Open an Object from within a Decision
On a node in the Decision Flow  diagram, double-click on the object name, or click 
 for the object that you want to open, and select Open .
On the Decision  tab, select the object that you want to open, click Edit, and select 
Open .
The object opens in the appropriate editor. Models open in SAS Model Manager if 
you have access to that application.
When you object an object on the Decision Flow  tab, the decision name at the top 
of the window is replaced with a breadcrumb. When you close an object, SAS 
Intelligent Decisioning  returns to the previous object in the breadcrumb. You can 
click on any object in the breadcrumb to switch to that object. Any object that 
appears later in the breadcrumb is automatically closed. For example, if you open 
version one of the card_approval decision, the calc_interest_rate nested decision, 
and the get_credit_data rule set, the breadcrumb appears as follows:
