updating. This name-value pair prevents a request from updating a resource with 
outdated content.
For example, you can submit a GET request to retrieve the content of a decision, 
modify it, and submit a PUT request to update the decision. The PUT request must 
include the If-Match
 header name and the value of the ETag header from the 
response to the initial GET request. If someone else modifies the decision before 
you submit your PUT request, then the ETag value is no longer valid and your 
request fails.
The header name that you need to specify in a PUT request is documented in the 
REST API documentation  for the request that you are submitting. Depending on the 
request, the header name is either If-Match
 or If-Unmodified-Since
. Specify the 
header name and its value with the conditionalPutKey
 and conditionalPutValue 
parameters for the put() function.Table 2.1 Conditional PUT Keys and ValuesconditionalPutKeyconditionalPutValueIf-MatchETag
 value from the response header for the last GET 
request for the resource.
The examples Chapter 5, “Activate Treatment Groups,” on 
page 25 and Chapter 8, “Update Subject Contact History,” 
on page 43 both submit PUT requests that include the If-Match
 header.If-Unmodified-SinceLast-Modified
 value from the response header for the last 
GET request for the resource.
The GET request returns this value in Coordinated Universal 
Time (UTC) format. However, when you specify this value in 
a PUT request, you must specify the value in the following 
format:day-name, day month year hour:minutes:seconds GMT
For example: Mon, 24 Aug 2020 20:58:15 GMT
For more information, see Last-Modified  in the MDN (Mozilla 
Developer Network) Web Docs.
