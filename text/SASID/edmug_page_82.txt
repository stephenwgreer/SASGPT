data is not recorded for other objects, including filtering rule sets that are used as 
eligibility rule sets in treatments.
For filtering rule sets that are included directly in a decision, rule-fired data is 
recorded for an input record if the rule set does not filter out the record. When the 
rule set filters out an input record, rule-fired data is not recorded for that input 
record.
For rule sets that iterate over a data grid (in other words, the rule sets score the 
rows in the data grid), the rule-fired data indicates that the rules in the rule set fire 
once for the entire data grid instead of firing once for each row in the data grid.
If the 
sas.decisions.nodetraces.includeRuleFiredPathTrackInfoInVariableAssignmentLogging
configuration option is turned off, you cannot run rule-fired analyses for scenario 
tests. For more information, see “Decisions Service Properties” in SAS Intelligent 
Decisioning: Administrator’s Guide .
TIP This rule-fired analysis uses the data that is in the ruleFiredFlags 
column in the test results output table. To analyze rule-fired data that is in the 
subject contact history, use the 
%DCM_GET_SUBJECTCONTACT_HISTORY and 
%DCM_RULEFIRE_DETAIL macros. For more information, see SAS 
Intelligent Decisioning: Macro Guide .
To run a rule-fired analysis:
1In the test results window, click Rule-Fired Analysis  in the navigation panel.
2Click Run Rule-Fired Analysis . SAS Intelligent Decisioning  analyzes the test 
results to determine which rules fired for each row in the input table, and displays 
the Analysis  page.
The Analysis  page displays the number of rules that fired for each output record 
that was generated by the decision. The number in the Rules Fired Count 
column is a link to more information. You can click on this link to display the rules 
that fired for that output row.
For example, the following displays shows the rule-fired analysis for the 
low_ratio rule set.Testing Rule Sets 71
