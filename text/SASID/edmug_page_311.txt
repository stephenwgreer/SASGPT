...<<decision variable values>>...OUT: decision - credit_card_offers
Between the IN and OUT lines for each node, the report records the initial value, 
final value, and mapping for each of the node’s variables. For example, if a node 
has an input-only variable named RATE, an output-only variable named 
NUM_OFFERS, and an input-output variable named ACCTSCORE, the report might 
contain the following lines:*Setting inOut Variable - ACCTSCORE ( mapped to ACCTSCORE )    *ValueReceived: 0.698    *ValueReturned: 0.796*Setting input Variable - RATE ( mapped to RETURN )      *ValueReceived: 15.4*Setting output Variable - num_offers ( mapped to num_offers )    *ValueReceived: .    *ValueReturned: 2
Note: A period (.) indicates a missing value. Boolean values are recorded as 0 
(false) and 1 (true).
Between the last node of the decision and the END node, the report contains the 
same information for each decision variable. These lines include the name of the 
decision. For example: *Setting credit_card_offers output Variable - zero_offers ( mapped to zero_offers )    *ValueReceived: .    *ValueReturned: 0
For branches, the report records the branch condition and the path that the test 
takes out of the branch. For example, suppose the decision has a range branch that 
has different paths for the CLAGE variable. If the test follows the path for the range 
of values 101–300, the trace file contains the following line:IN: branch - Range(CLAGE) 101 - 300==>GEN==>
In this case, the branch label is the default value 101 - 300
. If you customize the 
branch label, then 101 - 300==>GEN==>
 is replaced with the custom label.
If the decision has a Yes/No branch with the condition zero_offers=True
, and the 
test follows the No path, the trace file contains the following line:IN: branch - zero_offers=True onFalse
If the Score rows in this data grid  option is selected in the Input Variables property 
panel for a node, the IN line for that node lists the data grid that is being scored. For 
example, if the credit_card_offers decision contains a model named credit_limit and 
that model scores the data grid named card_offers_out, the trace file contains the 
following line:IN: model - credit_limit scoring datagrid card_offers_out of credit_card_offers row 1
