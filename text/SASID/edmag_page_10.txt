sas.decisions.clearOutputOnlyDataGridSubDecision
Specifies whether existing data is cleared in output-only data grids that are used in subdecisions 
before the subdecision executes. When this property is set to On, the data in the data grids is 
cleared. When this property is set to Off, data from previous runs is not cleared in the data grids.DefaultOff
sas.decisions.dataGridMetadataGenerating
Specifies whether DS2 packages that are published to SAS Micro Analytic Service destinations 
have two methods (step IDs), datagrid_metadata
 and datagrid_metadata_skel
, that you can 
use to determine the data grid metadata that is applicable to the decision flow. When this property 
is set to On, you can post a request to these steps to get data grid metadata. See Execute a step 
in the SAS Viya REST API documentation.
Note: If you enable this property, SAS Intelligent Decisioning generates more code for published 
objects and might increase the time required to publish an object to SAS Micro Analytic Service 
destinations. Enabling this option does not significantly affect the time required to execute 
published objects.DefaultOff
sas.decisions.deleteVersions
Enables users who have permission to delete decisions to delete specific versions of decisions.DefaultOn
sas.decisions.disableLineReporting
Specifies whether line numbers are included in DS2 error messages. When this option is turned 
off, lines numbers are included in error messages. When this option is turned on, lines numbers 
are not included in error messages.DefaultOff
sas.decisions.execution.threadCount
Specifies the maximum number of threads that can be allocated for executing DS2 code 
packages.
TIP When the Enable variable assignment logging  option is selected for a scenario 
test, this configuration option is ignored. The default thread count for the test is set to 1 in 
order to avoid duplicate and interleaved log entries. For more information, see “Enable 
Variable Assignment Logging” on page 39.Default4
sas.decisions.includeLoggingInGeneratedCode
Enables all logging, including performance logging, for decisions that are running in the Micro 
Analytic Score service.DefaultOnSee“Enabling Performance Logging” on page 36 9
