PropertyDescriptionInput  and 
OutputA variable can be an input variable, an output variable, both, or neither 
(a temporary variable). See “Input Variables, Output Variables, and 
Temporary Variables” on page 17 for more information.LengthThe length for Boolean and numeric variable types is set 
automatically.
For output-only data grid variables, the length is set to the value that 
you specify.
For character variables and data grid variables that are input-only or 
input-output variables, the variableLengthOverridden configuration 
property determines how the length is set. By default, this property is 
set to Off, and the length is set to the length in the input data. When 
the variableLengthOverridden property is set to On, the length of 
input-only and input-output character variables and data grid variables 
is set to the value that you specify. For more information, see 
“sas.businessrules.variableLengthOverridden” in SAS Intelligent 
Decisioning: Administrator’s Guide .
The maximum length for character variables (outside of a data grid) 
and data grid variables is 10485760 characters. The maximum length 
for character variables within a data grid is 32767 characters.Initial valueYou can specify an initial value for all data types except data grids. 
Initial values are used only at run time and only for output-only 
variables.
Note: For content that will be published to a SAS Micro Analytic 
Service destination, the values of date and datetime input variables 
must be numeric. They cannot be formatted values such as 18jul2019
. Also, integer variables are converted to decimal variables 
when the content is published.DescriptionDescriptions are limited to 256 characters.
Input Variables, Output Variables, and 
Temporary Variables
For each variable, you must specify whether the variable is an input variable, an 
output variable, both an input variable and an output variable, or a temporary 
variable.
nInput variables are variables that are present in the input table for a rule set. 
When a rule set is deployed in a production system, all input variables must be 
mapped to table columns in input data. When you test a rule set in SAS 
Intelligent Decisioning , for each input variable, you can either map it to a table 
column or specify a constant as its input value. If you choose not to map a 
variable to either a table column or a static value, SAS Intelligent Decisioning 
displays a warning message. When you create or edit a variable, clear the Input Managing the Variables in a Rule Set 17
