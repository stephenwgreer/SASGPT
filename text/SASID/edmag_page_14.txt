sas.decisions.codefiles.quoteStudioQueryIdentifiers
Specifies whether SAS Intelligent Decisioning encloses table and column identifiers in quotation 
marks when it generates DS2 code for custom data query files.
It is recommended that you turn this option on if you do not have existing query files that rely on 
table or column names that are not enclosed in quotation marks. For more information, see 
“Handling Table and Column Names in Data Query Files” in SAS Intelligent Decisioning: User’s

sas.decisions.masnode.removeTrailingUnderscoresFromInput
Determines whether underscores are appended to input-output and input-only variable names that 
are passed to the SAS Micro Analytic Service when a Micro Analytic Module node in a decision is 
executed. If this property is set to Off, SAS Intelligent Decisioning adds an underscore to the 
names of the variables. If this property is set to On, SAS Intelligent Decisioning does not add 
underscores.DefaultOffRequirementThe setting of this configuration property must match the setting of the 
service.removetrailingunderscoresfrominputs  property for the SAS Micro Analytic 
Service.NoteWhen both this property and the service.removetrailingunderscoresfrominputs 
property are set to On, publishing validation tests will fail for content that has been 
published to a SAS Micro Analytic Service destination.See“sas.microanalyticservice.system: supplementalProperties” in SAS Micro Analytic 
Service: Programming and Administration Guide“Executing Content Published to SAS Micro Analytic Service Destinations” in SAS
