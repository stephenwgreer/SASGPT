Configuring Publishing Destinations
About Configuring Publishing Destinations
You can publish content to destinations on SAS Cloud Analytic Services (CAS), Apache Hadoop, 
SAS Micro Analytic Service, Teradata, and Git. You can also publish content to container destinations 
on Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and private Docker 
repositories. By default, a SAS Micro Analytic Service destination named maslocal  is defined for you. 
You must configure all other publishing destinations.
You can define and manage publishing destinations by using the following application or interfaces:
nPublishing Destinations page  in SAS Environment Manager.
nSAS Viya: Models Command-Line Interface .
nModel Publish API . For additional information about using the API, see the following resources:
