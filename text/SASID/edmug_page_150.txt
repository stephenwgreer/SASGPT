Syntax
LOOKUP  ('lookup_table_name ', variable_or_value )
Required Arguments
lookup_table_name
specifies the name of the lookup table that you want to search.
variable_or_value
specifies either the literal key value or a variable that contains a lookup key 
value.
Example
Suppose you have a Country_Codes lookup table that uses two-letter abbreviations 
for countries as the lookup key and country names as the lookup values.
To verify that the value of the variable Cntry_Key exists as a lookup key in the table 
Country_Codes, you can use the following expression:LOOKUP('Country_Codes',Cntry_Key)
If the value of Cntry_Key exists as a lookup key, the LOOKUP function returns the 
value True
.
In the following rule, if the key specified by the variable Cntry_Key exists in the 
lookup table Country_Codes, then the value that is associated with that key is 
assigned to the variable Country_Name.
LOOKUPVALUE Function
Retrieves a lookup value from a lookup table.
Restrictions: You can specify the LOOKUPVALUE function only in action expressions.138 Chapter 4 / Working with Lookup Tables and Functions
