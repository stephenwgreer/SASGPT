In a lookup table, each lookup key  is associated with a lookup value . Lookup keys 
must be unique within each lookup table.
SAS Intelligent Decisioning  provides two functions, LOOKUP and LOOKUPVALUE, 
that enable you to determine whether a lookup key exists in a lookup table and to 
retrieve a lookup value from a lookup table.
About Labels for Lookup Keys and 
Values
You can specify labels to use for lookup keys and lookup values. For example, for 
the lookup table shown in Figure 4.2 on page 115, you could specify Country Abbreviation
 for the key and Country Name
 for the value.  You could specify the 
names of variables that are used to store the keys or values as the labels.
The labels that you enter are added to the Properties  tab for the lookup table. They 
are also included in windows that contain fields where you enter keys or values. For 
example, if you add labels to the lookup table shown in Figure 4.2 on page 115 and 
open the Add Table Entries  window, the labels are displayed in parentheses after 
the existing Key and Value  field labels.About Labels for Lookup Keys and Values 115
