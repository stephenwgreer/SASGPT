In the Custom Functions  category, you can define a custom function that calls the 
squareIt context function as follows:method addSquares() returns double;    dcl double tally;    dcl double squared;    dcl double i;    tally = 0;    do i= 1 to 5;       squared = application.squareIt(i);       tally + squared;    end;    return tally;end;
Referencing a Variable That Is Defined in a Context 
File
When you add a custom context file to an objectâ€™s properties, SAS Intelligent 
Decisioning  defines a variable in the generated code for the object that is named application
. This variable appears only in the generated code. It does not appear 
in the Variables  tab for the object.
You must use the application
 variable to refer to variables that are defined in the 
custom context file. To refer to a custom context variable from within a rule set, DS2 
code file, or custom function, use the following format:application.variable_name
For example, you could create a custom context file that sets the value of a variable 
named grade
 based on the value of the variable score
:package CustomContext;   dcl varchar(20) grade;   method execute(in_out double score);     if score >= 90 then grade='A';     else if score >= 80 then grade='B';     else if score >= 70 then grade='C';     else if score >= 60 then grade='D';     else grade='F';   end;endpackage;
In a rule set, you can execute the custom context file and set the value of the rule 
set variable finalGrade
 to the value of the custom context variable grade
 as 
follows:application.execute(score);finalGrade=application.grade;
