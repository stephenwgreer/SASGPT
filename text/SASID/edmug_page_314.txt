TIP If the log files that are generated by either the Enable variable change 
path logging  option or the Enable variable assignment logging  option are 
very large, you might need to increase the JVM heap size for the Subject 
Contact and Files services. Because of the storage required by these 
options, do not select both of these options in the same test. For more 
information, see “Subject Contact Service Properties” in SAS Intelligent 
Decisioning: Administrator’s Guide .
Instructions for enabling variable assignment logging are in Step 7 of “Create and 
Run a Scenario Test” on page 289.

Run a Rule-Fired Analysis
If a rule’s conditions evaluate to true, then the rule is said to have fired. Rule-fired 
data includes summary information about how many times each rule fired and 
detailed information for each time that a rule evaluates to true. See “How Rules Are 
Evaluated and When Rule-Fired Records Are Generated” on page 32 for more 
information.
Note: Rule-fired data is recorded only for rule sets, including rule sets in nested 
decisions and filtering rule sets that are included directly in a decision. Rule-fired 
data is not recorded for other objects, including filtering rule sets that are used as 
eligibility rule sets in treatments.
For filtering rule sets that are included directly in a decision, rule-fired data is 
recorded for an input record if the rule set does not filter out the record. When the 
rule set filters out an input record, rule-fired data is not recorded for that input 
record.
For rule sets that iterate over a data grid (in other words, the rule sets score the 
rows in the data grid), the rule-fired data indicates that the rules in the rule set fire 
once for the entire data grid instead of firing once for each row in the data grid.
Rule fired data is recorded for nested decisions only if the 
sas.decisions.includeRuleFiredInformationForSubdecisions  configuration option is 
turned on.If the 
sas.decisions.nodetraces.includeRuleFiredPathTrackInfoInVariableAssignmentLogging
configuration option is turned off, you cannot run rule-fired analyses for scenario 
tests. For more information, see “Decisions Service Properties” in SAS Intelligent
