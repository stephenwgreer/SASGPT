Defining Expressions in Rules and 
Assignment Statements
About Defining Expressions
Expressions can be up to 1024 characters long. They can contain numeric 
constants, character strings, variables, operators, SAS DS2 functions, data grid 
functions, and the SAS Intelligent Decisioning  LOOKUP and LOOKUPVALUE 
functions. You can enter expressions directly into the expression fields, or you can 
use the Expression Editor to create and edit expressions.
TIP Use caution when you test for equality by using scientific notation. Two 
numbers that appear to be the same might evaluate to different numbers 
because of the precision involved in scientific notation.

Using the Expression Editor
You can use the Expression Editor to enter expressions that do not use the 
LOOKUP or LOOKUPVALUE functions. You must use the Expression Editor to enter 
expressions that use the concatenation (||) operator or the exponent operator (**).
