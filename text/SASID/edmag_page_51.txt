About Permission Types
There are two types of permissions that you might need to set for users to work in SAS Intelligent 
Decisioning : folder-based permissions and rules-based permissions.Table 3 Permissions Types for SAS Intelligent Decisioning Permissions TypeWhen to UseFolder-based permissionsFor objects that are stored in folders, it is recommended that you use 
folder-based permissions to control what tasks users can perform for 
those objects. The objects that are stored in folders are rule sets, 
decisions, treatments, treatment groups, lookup tables, and custom 
code files.
Storing test definitions and test results in a folder is optional, but it is 
highly recommended. Storing test definitions and test results in a folder 
simplifies the tasks of setting permissions and transferring the files.
For more information, see “Folder-Based Permissions” on page 51.Rules-based permissionsFor tasks associated with publishing and for objects that are not stored 
in folders, you must use rules-based permissions. The objects that are 
not stored in folders are custom functions and global variables.50
