TIP If the log files that are generated by either the Enable variable change 
path logging  option or the Enable variable assignment logging  option are 
very large, you might need to increase the JVM heap size for the Subject 
Contact and Files services. Because of the storage required by these 
options, do not select both of these options in the same test. For more 
information, see “Subject Contact Service Properties” in SAS Intelligent 
Decisioning: Administrator’s Guide .
Instructions for enabling change path logging and for generating the report are in 
Step 6 and Step 16 of “Create and Run a Scenario Test” on page 289.
Using Variable Assignment Logging
When you run a scenario test for a decision, you can select Enable variable 
assignment logging  to record how variable values change as a decision runs. This 
option adds the following statement to the generated code:DS2_OPTIONS TRACEVARIABLES;
Note: To enable this option, your administrator must define the 
App.TableServices.DS2.Runtime.TraceVariables logger, and set other configuration 
options.
If you select this option and configure the logger, SAS Intelligent Decisioning  writes 
a log entry each time a variable is assigned a value. Each log entry includes the 
following information:
nthe line number in the generated code where the value is assigned
nthe type of code block in which the value was assigned (package
 or thread
)
nthe name of the code block that assigned the value
nthe line number in the individual code block
nthe variable name and its assigned value
Note: Log messages are limited to 32000 bytes, including the log message header. 
In locales that use multi-byte character sets, log entries might be truncated to 8000 
characters.
For example, if the decision includes a rule set named rs_hmeq_loan that sets the 
value of a variable named risky
, the trace file might contain the following lines:Line 1053 (package "56b88b7c_60c8_4c30_c8ec_82ea1b788180_rs_hmeq_loan" line 102):     "risky"=0Line 1058 (package "56b88b7c_60c8_4c30_c8ec_82ea1b788180_rs_hmeq_loan" line 107):     "risky"=1
These entries indicate that on line 1053 of the generated code, the variable risky is 
set to 0. This line is line 102 of the code block that was generated for the rule set. 
Similarly, the variable was set to 1 on line 1058 of the generated code.296 Chapter 8 / Working with Decisions
