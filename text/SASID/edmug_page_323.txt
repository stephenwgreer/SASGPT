Executing Published Content
How you execute published content depends on the destination to which the content 
is published.
Executing Content Published to SAS Micro Analytic 
Service Destinations
The user who is executing the published content must be authenticated. In SAS 
Viya, authentication options vary, based on which interface and operating system 
are used in your environment. External mechanisms include direct LDAP 
authentication, host authentication, Kerberos, Security Assertion Markup Language 
(SAML), and OAuth 2.0 with OpenID Connect. For additional information, see SAS 
Viya Platform: Authentication
When a decision is published from SAS Intelligent Decisioning  to a SAS Micro 
Analytic Service destination, an EXECUTE step is created in the published module. 
For information about the request and response data formats used in this step, see 
Execute a step  in the REST API documentation for the Micro Analytic Score API. 
For an example that uses Python to execute a published decision in the maslocal 
destination, see “Execute a Published Decision” in SAS Intelligent Decisioning: 
Decision Management REST API Examples .
IMPORTANT If the SAS Micro Analytic Service configuration property service.removetrailingunderscoresfrominputs
 and the SAS Intelligent 
Decisioning  property sas.decisions.masnode.removeTrailingUnderscoresFromInput
 are not 
defined or are set to False
, add an underscore to the name of each input 
variable. If these options are set to True
, do not add underscores. Your 
administrator can add the SAS Micro Analytic Service property to the supplementalProperties
 section in the sas.microanalyticservice.system
 configuration definition in SAS 
Environment Manager. The default value for these options is False
.For 
additional information, see “sas.microanalyticservice.system: 
supplementalProperties” in SAS Micro Analytic Service: Programming and 
Administration Guide  and
