2Specify the object ID of the decision that you want to publish. You can retrieve 
decision information by submitting GET requests to the /flows
 resource. You 
can use query parameters to narrow the results that are returned by the request. 
For more information, see Get a list of all decisions .
This ID is also shown on the Properties  tab when you open the decision in SAS 
Intelligent Decisioning.
3Specify a name for the publishing request. This name is a descriptive name that 
is displayed when you view the log of API calls on your network.
4Specify the name of the decision that you want to publish.
5Get the contents of the decision by submitting a GET request to the /decisions/flows/object-ID
 resource.
6Lock the current version of the decision (which becomes the new numbered 
version), and create a new, unlocked current version by submitting a POST 
request to the /decisions/flows/decision-ID/revisions
 resource. You can 
specify the versionType
 parameter to control whether a major version or a 
minor version is created.
After this request executes, the object ID now points to the locked and numbered 
version of the decision.
7Get the generated DS2 code for the locked version of the decision by submitting 
a GET request to the /decisions/flows/decision-ID/code
 resource. Because 
SAS Micro Analytic Service destinations do not generated rule-fired information 
or path-tracking information, include the following query parameters:?lookupMode=inline&traversedPathFlag=false\&isGeneratingRuleFiredColumn=false&codeTarget=microAnalyticService
The generated code is returned as a byte object.
8Convert the byte object to a string, and escape newline characters and double 
quotation marks. Specify the resulting character string as the code property for 
the model in the publish request in Step 10 .
9Define the URL to the source code of the locked version of the decision.
10Define the request body for the publish request. Specify the following 
parameters:

this value is microAnalyticService
.
destinationName
