Opening the Original Object
When you check out an object, SAS Intelligent Decisioning  adds the field Original 
object link  to the Properties  tab for the checked-out object. This field contains a 
link to the original object that was checked out. You can use this link to verify that 
you have checked out the correct version and to compare the original content with 
the modified content in the checked-out version.
Undoing a Check Out
If both an object and a decision that uses the object are checked out at the same 
time, or if you checked out the object from within the decision , click  on the 
object's node in the decision diagram, and select Cancel checkout .
You can discard a checked-out version and any changes that you made by deleting 
the working copy of the version from your My Folder
 folder if the following 
conditions are true:
nYou have not checked out a decision that uses the object.
nThe object was not checked out at the same time as a decision  that uses the 
object,  or the object was not checked out from within the decision  after the 
decision was checked out.
The deleted version is moved to the recycle bin. See “Delete Decisions” on page 
262.
Managing Version Tags for Decisions
Add a Version Tag
Version tags enable you to better organize and group your content. Version tags are 
associated with specific versions of an object and not with the entire object. You can 
add the same tag to any version of any object. To add a tag to a decision version:
1On the Versions  tab, position your cursor in the Version Tags  column for the 
version that you want to tag. If the version is not tagged,  appears. If the 
version has at least one tag,  appears.
2Click  to open the New Version Tags  window, or click  to open the Edit 
Version Tags  window.
3For each tag that you want to add, either enter a custom tag or begin typing and 
select a tag from the list of previously entered tags. Press Enter after each tag. Managing Version Tags for Decisions 277
