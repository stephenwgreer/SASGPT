code takes for each destination type.Table 8.1 What SAS Intelligent Decisioning  Publishes to Each Destination Type Destination TypeWhat SAS Intelligent Decisioning  Does SAS Cloud Analytic

same name as the published object and writes the 
generated code to a file named scoreResource.txt
. If the 
decision includes analytic store models, the model files are 
written as either .sasast
 files or .astore
 files, depending 
on how the model was built.Container destinationsCreates a SAS Container Runtime  container and writes it to 
the destination.
Note: The container destination types to which you can 
publish content from SAS Intelligent Decisioning  are 
Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, Google 
Cloud Platform (GCP), and private Docker repositories.
The rows in the model tables, the Micro Analytic Service modules, and the SAS 
Container Runtime containers all become callable REST API endpoints, 
independent of SAS Intelligent Decisioning . For content that is published to Git 
destinations, you can use the SAS Intelligent Decisioning  Git Deployment CLI to 
deploy content from the remote repository either to a CAS destination or to a SAS 
Micro Analytic Service destination.  The deployed content then becomes a callable 
REST API endpoint.
Where Can I Publish Decisions?
The destinations to which you can publish a decision depend on the destinations 
that are available and on the objects that are used in the decision. Your system 
administrator determines which publishing destinations are available. The following 
table shows the destination types to which you can publish a decision that contains 
various object types.Publishing a Decision 279
