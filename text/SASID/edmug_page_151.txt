If an expression contains the LOOKUPVALUE function, then the expression cannot 
contain anything else.
Returned data 
type:CHARACTER, INTEGER, DECIMAL, DATE, DATETIME, BOOLEAN
Tip: Lookup tables are stored as character data. However, you can assign the results of the 
LOOKUPVALUE function to any of the returned data types. The LOOKUPVALUE 
function converts the results to match the type of the variable.
Syntax
LOOKUPVALUE  ('lookup_table_name ', variable_or_value )
Required Arguments
lookup_table_name
specifies the name of the lookup table that you want to search.
variable_or_value
specifies either the literal key value or a variable that contains the lookup key 
value.
Example
Suppose you have a Country_Codes lookup table that uses two-letter abbreviations 
for countries as the lookup key and country names as the lookup values. The 
Country_Codes lookup table contains the lookup key CA
, and the lookup value that 
corresponds to that key is Canada
.
If the Cntry_Key variable in the current input record contains the value CA
, you can 
use the following expression to retrieve the lookup value that is associated with that 
key from the table Country_Codes:LOOKUPVALUE('Country_Codes',Cntry_Key)
In the following rule, if the key specified by the variable Cntry_Key exists in the 
lookup table Country_Codes, then the value that is associated with that key is 
assigned to the variable Country_Name.LOOKUPVALUE Function 139
