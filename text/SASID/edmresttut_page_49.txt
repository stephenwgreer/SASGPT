How To
1Get an access token by submitting a GET request to the /SASLogon/oauth/token
 resource. The example described in Chapter 2, “Define Basic Methods 
and Get an Access Token”  includes the code required to get an access token. 
Prepend that code to the code for this example.
2Specify the tracking code of the subject contact record and treatment ID of the 
treatment that you want to update. These values are returned by the decision 
that determines the treatments for which the subject is eligible.
3Define the record-level updates that you want to make to the subject contact 
record. You can update the following properties of the record:
conclusionResponseValue
the subject’s response to the results of the decision. You can use this 
property to record a response when a decision does not include treatments. 
When the decision includes treatments, this value might represent an overall 
response to all of the treatments in the subject contact record.
conclusionResponseType
a summary value, category name, or other description for the response that 
is specified in the conclusionResponseValue property. For example, you 
could assign the type of Evaluating
, No response
, or Closed-Lost
 to the 
response. This value can be used as a target value in modeling.
4Define the treatment-level updates that you want to make to the individual 
treatment. You can update the following properties of individual treatments:
presented
specifies whether the treatment has been presented to the subject. Specify True
 or False
.
presentedTimeStamp
timestamp that indicates when the treatment was presented to the subject. 
Enter the timestamp in the following format:yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss.sssZ
Include the Coordinated Universal Time designator Z
 (for example, 2019-11-14T18:47:40.719Z
).
For more information about timestamps, see Date and Time Formats .
responseValue
the subject’s response to the treatment. For example, this value could be a 
value or code such as Purchased
, Rejected
, Requested quote
, Email opened
, rt1
, or em
.
responseChannel
the channel through which the user responded to the treatment. The 
response channel might be different from the contact channel. The possible 
values for the channel are defined in the Treatment Channels lookup table.
