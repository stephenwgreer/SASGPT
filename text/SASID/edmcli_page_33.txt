Transfer Version Comments
When you use the transfer plug-in to the sas-viya CLI to transfer objects between 
SAS Viya environments, all of the content is transferred except for notes that are 
associated with specific versions of the objects. To transfer the version notes for an 
object, complete these steps:
1Export a transfer package from the source environment that contains the version 
notes that are associated with the object:sas-viya transfer export   --resource-uri /comments/comments?filter=startsWith(resourceUri,'object-uri')
The object URI is displayed on the Properties  tab for the object in SAS 
Intelligent Decisioning, or you can retrieve object URIs by using the SAS 
Intelligent Decisioning REST API. Object URIs have the following format:/businessRules/ruleSets/rule-set-ID/decisions/flows/decision-ID/referenceData/domains/lookup-table-ID/treatmentDefinitions/definitions/treatment-ID/treatmentDefinitions/definitionGroups/treatment-group-ID
Record the transfer package ID.
2Download the package to your local machine, and store it in a JSON file named 
MyPackage.json:sas-viya transfer download --id transfer-package-ID --file /tmp/MyPackage.json
3Upload the JSON file to the target environment:sas-viya transfer upload --file /tmp/MyPackage.json
Record the upload package ID.29
