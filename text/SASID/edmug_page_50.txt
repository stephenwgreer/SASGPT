If a variableâ€™s value matches the pattern that is specified by pattern-matching-
expression , the expression evaluates to true (1). Otherwise, the expression

The LIKE expression is case sensitive. To search for mixed-case strings, use the 
UPCASE function to create an uppercase version of the variable that you want to 
search. You can use a temporary variable to store the results of the UPCASE 
function. Use the LIKE operator to search the uppercase version of the variable. For 
example, you can search the variable Part_Number for mixed-case strings that 
begin with HS and end with PP by using the two rules shown in the following figure.
The following table shows examples of the matches that result if you search a 
variable that could have these values: Smith, Smooth, Smothers, Smart, Smuggle.Table 2.3 Examples of LIKE Expressions LIKE Expression ExampleMatching Resultslike 'Sm%'Smith, Smooth, Smothers, Smart, Smugglelike '%th'Smith, Smoothlike 'S__gg%'Smugglelike 'S_o'
