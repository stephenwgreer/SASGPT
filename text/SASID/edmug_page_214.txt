Using the Custom Function Editor
Use the custom function editor to enter the code for custom functions.
To open the custom function editor, select a function in the Custom Function 
category view.
You can enter code directly into the code field, or you can use the lists of operators 
and functions to add them to the code for the custom function.
nTo add an operator, click the operator in the rows above the code pane. Click 
to select additional operators that are not visible in the rows above the code 
pane.
nTo add a function call, expand the appropriate function category on the 
Functions  tab, and double-click the function name. The custom function editor 
adds a basic syntax template for the function at the cursor's position in the code 
field.
The icon beside each function name indicates the return type of the function. 
Functions that return character data are displayed with the  icon, and functions 
that return numeric data are displayed with the  icon.
You can click Validate  at any time to check the syntax of the function that you are 
building. If the code does not compile correctly, SAS Intelligent Decisioning  displays 
detailed information in the Validation Results  window.
When you are finished editing the function, click Save .200 Chapter 7 / Using Custom Functions
