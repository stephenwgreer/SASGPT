sas.businessrules.dataGridMetadataGenerating
Specifies whether DS2 packages that are published to SAS Micro Analytic Service destinations 
have two methods (step IDs), datagrid_metadata
 and datagrid_metadata_skel
, that you can 
use to determine the data grid metadata that is applicable to the rule flow. When this property is 
set to On, you can post a request to these steps to get data grid metadata. See Execute a step  in 
the SAS Viya REST API documentation.DefaultOff
sas.businessrules.deleteVersions
Enables users who have permission to delete rule sets to delete specific versions of rule sets.DefaultOn
sas.businessrules.execution.threadCount
Specifies the maximum number of threads that can be allocated for executing DS2 code 
packages.Default4
sas.businessrules.inlineGlobalVariableValues
specifies whether the current values of global variables are included inline in generated code 
when you publish a rule set to CAS or to SAS Micro Analytic Service destinations. When this 
property is set to On, the current value of each global variable is included in the code that is 
generated for these destinations. Changes to the values of the variables do not affect published 
rule sets. When this property is set to Off, the generated code uses a SAS format or a SAS Micro 
Analytic Service module to retrieve the current value of the global variable when the rule set is 
run.DefaultOnSee“Activating a Global Variable” in SAS Intelligent Decisioning: User’s Guide
sas.businessrules.inputVariableReadOnly
Determines whether the values of character variables that are designated as input-only variables 
are available to all objects in a decision. When inputVariableReadOnly is set to Off and the value 
of an input-only character variable is modified in a rule set, the modified value is passed back to 
the parent decision and is available to the remaining objects in the decision. When this property is 
set to On, modified values are not passed back to the parent decision and are available only 
within the rule set in which the value was modified.DefaultOff
sas.businessrules.logicalExpression
Specifies whether SAS Intelligent Decisioning adds the DS2 option LOGICALEXPR= to the code 
that it generates for rule sets. The LOGICALEXPR= option specifies how logical AND and OR 
expressions are evaluated. Valid option values are STANDARD and OPTIMIZED.STANDARDspecifies that DS2 can evaluate both operands of a logical AND or OR 
expression before returning a result.OPTIMIZEDspecifies that DS2 optimizes the evaluation of the operands of logical AND and 
OR expressions by returning a result that is based on the first operand when 
possible. Specifying OPTIMIZED can enable the code to run faster and can 
simplify the processing of complex rule conditions.DefaultSTANDARD 5
