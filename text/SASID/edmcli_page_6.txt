Downloading and Installing the CLIs
The recommended approach for running the SAS Intelligent Decisioning CLIs is to 
run them as plug-ins to the SAS Viya Command-Line (sas-viya CLI). The most 
current plug-ins are included with the sas-viya CLI download file. You can download 
the sas-viya CLI directly from the SAS Support website and install the plug-ins that 
you need. The download file is available at 
https://support.sas.com/downloads/browse.htm?fil=&cat=564 . For information about 
downloading the CLI file and installing plug-ins, see “Get the CLI and Its Plug-Ins” in 
SAS Viya: Using the Command-Line Interface .
Creating and Using Profiles
To use these CLIs, you must create at least one profile and sign in to SAS Viya. The 
CLIs connect to the SAS Viya environment that is specified in your profile. If you do 
not specify a profile in the CLI command, the CLI uses the default profile. To 
connect to a different SAS Viya environment, use the --profile
 global option in the 
CLI command to specify a different profile. For more information, see the following 
topics:

Interface
