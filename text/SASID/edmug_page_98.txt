Figure 3.1 Example Decision That Uses Treatments
This decision flow has the following elements:
1The data query node named Get_customer_Info queries the company database 
and retrieves additional information about the subject based on the subject ID. 
For example, if the treatment is an offer to upgrade the subject’s cell phone, the 
SQL query could retrieve the model number for the subject’s current phone, if 
that information is available. For more information, see “Data Query Files” on 
page 159.
Nodes that retrieve additional information about the subject are typical but not 
required.
2The treatment group name Combined_Treatments_Final defines a set of 
treatments (offers) and includes rules that define who is eligible to receive the 
treatments. The decision uses the information about the subject and the eligibility 
rules to determine the treatments for which the subject qualifies.
When you add a treatment group to a decision, SAS Intelligent Decisioning 
defines an output variable of type data grid. After the decision executes, this 
data grid contains a row for each treatment for which the subject qualifies.86Chapter 3 / Working with Treatments and Treatment Groups
