when it is included in a treatment group.
Dynamic
The values of dynamic attributes can be set by the decision at run-time. 
When you define a dynamic attribute, you can specify a default value or a 
list of default values for the attribute. Within each treatment group in which 
the attribute appears, you can specify that the attribute’s value is set by 
the decision at run time, or you can set a static value that is used only 
within that specific treatment group.
Fixed
You define the value or list of values for fixed attributes when you define 
the attribute. The values cannot be customized in treatment groups.Managing Attributes and Aliases 95
