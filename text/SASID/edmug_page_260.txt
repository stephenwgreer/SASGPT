Adding Cross-Branch Links
Overview of Cross-Branch Links
Cross-branch links enable you to easily reuse components in a decision. You can 
add a cross-branch link to a target node at a branch level that is the same as or 
lower than the level of the source node. You can add cross-branch links that link to 
the End node, but you cannot add a cross-branch link that ends at the Start node.
For example, given the decision shown in the following figure, you can add cross-
branch links between any of the rule sets.
The Range branch has one path for each of three different ranges of loan values. 
Suppose you want all three paths to include the Set_interest_rate rule set, and you 
want both the mid-range and Other path to include the Verify_equity_amt rule set. 
You can add a cross-branch link from the Review_collateral node to the 
Verify_equity_amt node and a cross-branch link from the Verify_equity_amt node to 
the Set_interest_rate node.244 Chapter 8 / Working with Decisions
