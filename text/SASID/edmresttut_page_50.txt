responseType
a summary value, category name, or other description for the response that 
is specified in the value of the responseValue property. For example, you 
could assign the category of Positive
, Negative
, or Neutral
 to the subject’s 
response. This value can be used as a target value in modeling.
respondedTimeStamp
a timestamp that indicates when the subject responded to the treatment. 
Enter the timestamp in the following format:yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss.sssZ
Include the Coordinated Universal Time designator Z
 (for example, 2019-11-14T18:47:40.719Z
).
For more information about timestamps, see Date and Time Formats .
5Use the tracking code to define the URL for retrieving the subject contact record, 
and define the accept type for the request.
6Get the subject contact record by submitting a GET request 
to /subjectContacts/contacts?filter=eq(responseTrackingCode,'trackingCode')
.
7Convert the response body to a JSON object, and extract the object ID of the 
subject contact record.
8Use the object ID to define the URL for retrieving the subject contact record, and 
define the accept type for the request.
9Get the subject contact record by submitting a GET request 
to /subjectContacts/contacts/object-ID
. 
10Retrieve the ETag value from the response header. For information about ETag 
values, see “Updating Objects with the put() Function” on page 5.
11Convert the response body to a JSON object, and use the respBodyObjJSON 
object’s update method to add the record-level updates.
12Create an updated treatment list. For each treatment listed in the subject contact 
record that was returned in Step 9 , complete these steps:
aTest whether the treatment ID matches the ID of the treatment to update, and 
if so, append the treatment-level updates to the treatment.
bAppend the treatment to the updated treatment list.
13Create a new Python dictionary with the key treatmentsForConsideration
 and 
the value of the updated treatments list.
14Use the respBodyObjJSON object’s update method to replace the treatmentsForConsideration
 property in the subject contact record with the 
updated treatments list. The respBodyObjJSON object now contains a complete, 
updated subject contact history record.
15Convert the respBodyObjJSON object to a string so that you can specify it as the 
request body for the PUT request in Step 17 .
16Define the content type for submitting PUT requests to update subject contact 
records.How To 45
