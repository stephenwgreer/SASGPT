Managing Permissions
About Permissions
You use SAS Environment Manager to manage identities and authorization for SAS Viya. Information 
is available in the SAS Viya administration documentation:
n“Authorization in SAS Viya” in SAS Viya Platform: Orientation to Authorization
n“Identity Management: Overview” in SAS Viya: Identity Management
nSAS Viya Platform: External Credentials
You can configure user access based on folders, object types, or specific objects. You can control 
which categories appear in the user interface by controlling access to root endpoints. To grant full 
access to an object, a user must have access to all of the service endpoints (object URIs) that are 
associated with the object. For more information, see “Full Access and Service Endpoints” on page 
54.
The default permissions for SAS Intelligent Decisioning are described in “Default Permissions” on
