two objects. This tab displays the name, type, initial value (if a value is defined), 
and length of each variable in both objects. The tab also indicates whether the 
variable is an input variable or an output variable. If the variable list for both 
objects is the same, this tab displays a message stating that the two objects are 
identical.
If either of the objects that you are comparing contain a data grid variable, you 
can click 
  beside the variable name to display the data type and length of each 
data grid column.44Chapter 2 / Working with Rule Sets
