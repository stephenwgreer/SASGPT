You can use custom functions to perform actions that are not available with the 
standard functions that SAS provides. Custom functions also enable you to 
encapsulate and reuse business logic. You can use custom functions in rule sets 
and in DS2 code files.
When SAS Intelligent Decisioning  generates the code for a published object, the 
definitions for custom functions are duplicated each time the function is referenced.

Code File
When you add a function category and custom function to SAS Intelligent

functions in the rule set expression editor. Custom categories appear as 
subcategories under the category Custom. For example, if you add a function 
category named Exponential and a function named square
