Test a Code File
Create and Run a New Test
Testing a code file is optional, but doing so is a best practice. Testing enables you to 
discover any problems before the code file is incorporated into a production system.
IMPORTANT If you are testing a DS2 or SQL code file that uses functions 
that are defined in a custom context file, verify that the context file is specified 
in the Test custom context  field on the Properties  before running the test.
1On the Scoring  tab, click the Tests  tab. 
2Click New Test . The New Test  window appears.
3Enter a name for the test if you do not want to use the default name. The name 
cannot contain forward slashes (/) or curly braces ({}).
4(Optional) Enter a description for the test. Descriptions are limited to 1000 
characters.
5(Optional) Click  for the Location  field, and select the folder where you want to 
save the test definition and results.
TIP Selecting a location is optional, but it is highly recommended. 
Storing test definitions and test results in a folder simplifies the tasks of 
setting permissions and transferring the test files.
6Click  for the Input table  field, select the input table for the test, and click OK. 
7Verify or change the variable mappings. To run a full test, map all of the input 
variables to columns in the input table that you selected for the test. To run a 
partial test, you can map only the input variables that are needed for the test.
SAS Intelligent Decisioning  automatically maps the input variables in the code 
file to columns in the input table when the names and data types of the variables 
match those of the table columns.
If any input variables are not mapped to input columns or to static values, the 
application displays a warning message. At run time, SAS Intelligent Decisioning 
assigns missing values to input variables that are not mapped.
