of the treatments in the folder MyTreatments, specify the following request:<?xml version="1.0"?><MAExtractRequest detail="ALL">    <TreatmentDO>        <Folder operator="=">            <Name operator="=">MyTreatments</Name>        </Folder>    </TreatmentDO></MAExtractRequest>
You can also extract treatments based on treatment names, IDs, descriptions, and other criteria.

 as the input style sheet and transform_treatments.xslt
 as the output style sheet.sasmaextract domain\user-ID password authorization-domain     business-context-of-the-treatments     extract_request.xml     output-filename     pass_thru.xslt     transform_treatments.xslt

Transfer Content from SAS Viya 3.5 Environments
To transfer content from SAS Decision Manager 5.x or SAS Intelligent Decisioning 5.x on Viya 3.5 to 
the latest release of SAS Intelligent Decisioning on SAS Viya 4, use the SAS Administrative CLI on 
Viya 3.5 to export the content. For information, see SAS Viya 3.5 Administration: Promotion (Import 
and Export) . Notes that are associated with specific versions of the object are not transferred with the 
object. You can add notes to the source objects in the new environment, or manually transfer the 
notes. For more information about transferring version notes, see “Transfer Version Comments” in
