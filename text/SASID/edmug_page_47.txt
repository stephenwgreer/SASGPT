bSelect the record whose key you want to use in the expression, and click 
Save .
For example, suppose you have a lookup table in which the lookup keys are ZIP 
codes and the lookup values are city names. You could use the following rule to test 
whether the lookup table contains an entry for the ZIP code, and, if the entry exists, 
retrieve the city name that is associated with the ZIP code.
Entering Literal Data Values
Depending on whether you use the Expression Editor or enter expressions directly 
into the expression fields, you must enter some values differently.Data TypeHow To Enter ValuesExampleCharacterEnclose character strings in quotation 
marks. If the character string contains 
embedded quotation marks, use 
different quotation marks for the 
embedded and enclosing quotation 
marks.'Gold Account'"d'oscail"'d"oscail'
Data gridEnclose data grid JSON strings in single 
quotation marks.
Note: The only time you might need to 
enter JSON strings manually is when 
you are using the DATAGRID_CREATE 
function.See SAS Intelligent Decisioning: Using 
Data Grids  for an explanation of the 
JSON syntax and a description of the 
DATAGRID_CREATE function.DateIn the rule set editor, enter Date values 
by using the format DDMMMYYYY. 
Enclose each value in single quotation 
marks followed by d
.'01AUG2017'd
In the Expression Editor, use the DS2 
function TO_DOUBLE and specify the 
DATE data type in order to cast the Date 
value so that it can be compared 
correctly to other variables. See SAS 
DS2 Programmerâ€™s Guide  for 
information about date, time, and 
timestamp values, and see SAS DS2 
Language Reference  for information 
about the TO_DOUBLE function.to_double(date '2017-11-04')
