Run a Path Tracking Analysis
Decision path tracking shows you the route that input records take through the 
nodes in your decision.
Note: The path-tracking results do not include data for input records that are filtered 
out with a filtering rule set.
Path-tracking analyses include information for nested decisions only if the 
sas.decisions.includeRuleFiredInformationForSubdecisions  configuration option is 
turned on.
If the 
sas.decisions.nodetraces.includeRuleFiredPathTrackInfoInVariableAssignmentLogging
configuration option is turned off, you cannot run path-tracking analyses for scenario 
tests.Testing Decisions 301
