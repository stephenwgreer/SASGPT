Testing Decisions
Ways to Test a Decision
There are three types of tests:
Basic test
executes the decision in the SAS Cloud Analytic Services (CAS) destination 
using the input table that you specify. You can also specify a debugging variable 
and enable value tracing. For more information, see “Create and Run a New 
Test” on page 285.
Scenario test
enables you to enter specific input values and the output values that you expect 
the test to generate. A scenario test identifies differences between the output 
that you expect to see and the actual output that is generated when the test is 
run. You can also compare the test definitions and test results of different 
scenarios. Scenario tests are also run in CAS. For more information, see “Test a 
Scenario” on page 289.
Publishing validation test
executes the decision in a publishing destination using the input table that you 
specify. When you publish the decision, a validation test is automatically defined 284 Chapter 8 / Working with Decisions
