1Rule sets and nested decisions can use lookup tables, custom functions, and global variables.
2The score code type of a model determines the destination types to which you can publish a decision that contains the 
model. See Table 8.3 on page 280.
3In container destinations, Oracle is the only database that can be queried by using data query files, DS2 code files that 
contain SQL queries, or custom context files that contain SQL queries.
The score code type of a model determines the destination types to which you can 
publish a decision that contains those models. The following table lists the score 
code types a model can have when it is used in a decision that is published to a 
specific destination type.Table 8.3 Model Score Code Types and the Destinations to Which Decisions Can Be Published
