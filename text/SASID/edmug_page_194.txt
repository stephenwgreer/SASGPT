Version  tab for the object.

of the target code file. The target object contains only the pasted content.

Note: When you copy the contents of a source object into a target object, SAS

object is modified after you copy its contents, and you later copy the contents of the 
target object back into the source object, SAS Intelligent Decisioning  displays a 
warning message. Verify that you want to replace the current contents of the source 
object before you paste the new content.
