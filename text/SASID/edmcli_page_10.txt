dcmtransfer Plug-In
Enables you to transfer rule sets, rule flows, lookup tables, and decisions from a SAS 9.4 environment to a 
SAS Viya environment.
Requirement: You must create a profile and sign in before you use the CLI. See “Creating and Using 
Profiles” on page 2 for more information.
Notes: Data tables, tests, comments, attachments, and version information are not transferred 
from SAS 9.4 to SAS Viya. Vocabularies are not transferred, but the terms used in rule 
sets and decisions are transferred within those objects.
Lookup tables must be activated in the target environment. See “Activating a Lookup 
Table” in SAS Intelligent Decisioning: User’s Guide  for more information.
To transfer content between SAS Viya environments, use the transfer plug-in to the sas-
viya CLI. All of the content is transferred except for notes that are associated with 
specific versions of the objects. For more information, see “Command-Line Interface: 
Overview” in SAS Viya: Using the Command-Line Interface  and “Transfer Version 
Comments” on page 29.
