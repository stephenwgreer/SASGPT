target_dataGrid
specifies the name of the target data grid. This argument must be a variable of 
type DATAGRID. Any existing data in the target data grid is overwritten.
Details
The DATAGRID_INNERJOIN function performs an inner join of two data grids for 
which dataGrid1 .keyColumn1  equals dataGrid2 .keyColumn2  and populates the 
target data grid with the results of the join. The target table includes all rows from 
dataGrid1  that match rows in dataGrid2 . Unmatched rows from both data grids are 
discarded.
When the column names in the two data grids are identical, the columns from the 
left side of the join are added to the resulting data grid.
DATAGRID_LEFTJOIN Function
Performs a left join of two data grids, returns the resulting data grid, and populates the target data grid with 
the results of the join.
Category: Join or Append
Returned data 
type:INTEGER
Note: This function returns the number of rows in the target data grid.
