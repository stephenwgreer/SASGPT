TIP Whether a lookup table that is active in the source environment is 
automatically activated in the target environment is determined by the setting 
of the activation.activateLookupOnImport  configuration option. This option 
affects tables that are imported by using the SAS Viya Command-Line (sas-
viya)SAS administrative CLI (sas-admin) and by using SAS Environment 
Manager. For more information, see “Reference Data Service Properties” in 
SAS Intelligent Decisioning: Administrator’s Guide .
Format of the Lookup CSV Import File
Note: The format of the CSV file depends on whether you are importing a CSV file 
by using the Import  button in the user interface or by using the 
%DCM_IMPORT_LOOKUP macro. For information about the format that the macro 
uses, see “Format of the Lookup CSV Input File for the Macro” in SAS Intelligent 
Decisioning: Macro Guide . 
Do not include a header row in the CSV file. Each row of the CSV input file identifies 
a key-value pair. To create a blank column in the CSV file, specify two comma 
separators without any content between them.
The following example specifies the keys AU
 and CA
 and associates them with the 
values Australia
 and Canada
, respectively.AU,AustraliaCA,Canada
In a spreadsheet application, this lookup table appears as shown in the following 
figure.
Import Entries or Refresh Lookup Tables from CSV 
Files
Note: It is recommended that a single lookup table contains no more than 10,000 
entries. If you are importing a very large lookup table, you might need to increase 
the JVM heap size for the businessRulesReferenceData service. For more 118 Chapter 4 / Working with Lookup Tables and Functions
