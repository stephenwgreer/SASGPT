package name
the name of the generated DS2 package.
node name
the name of node that is displayed in the SAS Intelligent Decisioning user interface.
The log entry for the entire decision does not include the node name.
node ID
a unique ID for each node. When multiple decisions are running simultaneously, the logging for 
both decisions might be interleaved in the SAS Micro Analytic Service log file. If those decisions 
both contain a node with the same name, you can use the node ID to identify the node.
The log entry for the entire decision does not include the node name.
total duration
the elapsed time, in seconds, that it took the node or package to execute. If the number is very 
small, it is displayed in scientific notation such as 1.9073486328125E-6.
For example, the following log entry shows the execution time for the node named cellPhone_demo 
in the package cellPhone_demo_0:2019-07-03T15:46:56,659 [00000008] DEBUG App.tk.SID.Perf - Package Name: cellPhone_demo_0, Node Name: cellPhone_demo, Node ID: cbe4d5ea-05fe-442a-a2d2-26d5d2d754ea, TOTAL DURATION:0.04584789276123
The following log entry shows the execution time for the node named AggregatePromoPredicator in a 
subdecision, for which the time is very small:2019-07-03T15:46:56,615 [00000008] DEBUG App.tk.SID.Perf - Package Name: c_VY76XRZ7GFEP3DRTS3BVA6SPLM, Node Name: AggregatePromoPredicator, Node ID: 04200f5f-2903-44aa-90a2-156890a7fc18, TOTAL DURATION:1.9073486328125E-6
The following entry shows the total execution time for the cellPhone_demo_0 package:2019-07-03T15:47:01,264 [00000008] DEBUG App.tk.SID.Perf - Package Name: cellPhone_demo_0, TOTAL DURATION:1.5830275082711
Enable Performance Logging
1Create the App.tk.SID.Perf logger. This logger captures the execution times for the decision 
nodes. For instructions, see “Create the App.tk.SID.Perf Logger”  below. For more information 
about logging, see “SAS Micro Analytic Service Logging” in SAS Micro Analytic Service: 
Programming and Administration Guide .
2Verify that the includeLoggingInGeneratedCode configuration property is turned on. When this 
property is on, additional LOG statements are added to the generated DS2 code. These 
statements write performance information to the SAS Micro Analytic Service log. For more 
information, see “Decisions Service Properties” on page 8.
