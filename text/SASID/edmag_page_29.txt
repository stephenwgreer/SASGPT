Configurations
About the Subject Contacts and Treatment 
Definition Databases
By default, the subject contacts and treatment definitions are stored in the PostgreSQL instance that 
was installed with SAS Viya. You can use Oracle or a different instance of PostgreSQL for these 
databases. For more information, see “Configure Third-Party Databases” on page 28.
IMPORTANT SAS Intelligent Decisioning  does not support third-party configurations in 
environments that are configured for multi-tenancy.
Configure Third-Party Databases
By default, the subject contacts database and the treatment definitions database are stored in the 
PostgresSQL instance that was installed with SAS Viya. If you want to use that instance of 
PostgreSQL for your subject contacts and treatment definitions databases, no additional configuration 
is required.
Alternatively, you can use Oracle or a different instance of PostgresSQL for either or both of these 
databases. Complete these steps to configure a third-party database:
1(Optional) To preserve treatment groups that are stored in the PostgresSQL instance that was 
installed with SAS Viya, use SAS Environment Manager or the transfer plug-in to the sas-viya CLI 
to export the treatment groups. Select the Include dependencies  check box in SAS Environment 28
