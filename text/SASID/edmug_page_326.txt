recently published version of the specified module.SAS Cloud 
Analytic 
ServicesMost of the published decision’s content is locked. Updates to rule 
sets, models, treatment groups, custom functions, or custom code 
files that are used in the decision do not affect the published 
decision.
The current values of global variables are included in generated 
code if the inlineGlobalVariableValues configuration option is turned 
on, and published modules do not use newly activated versions of 
global variables. If this option is turned off, the generated code uses 
a SAS format to retrieve the current value of the global variable 
when the published module is run. For more information, see 
“sas.decisions.inlineGlobalVariableValues” in SAS Intelligent 
Decisioning: Administrator’s Guide .
Lookup tables are locked if the lookupStaticBinding configuration 
option is turned on. If this option is off, lookup tables are not locked, 
and published modules use newly activated versions of lookup 
tables. For more information, see

DestinationsAll of the published decision’s content, including treatment groups, 
custom functions, lookup tables, and global variables is included 
inline in the published module. Updates to the objects used in the 
decision are not used by the published module.
View All Published Decisions
The Deployments category view is a dashboard that provides a centralized view of 
information about all the decisions that are being used in your environment.
Click  to navigate to the Deployments category view.
The tiles at the top of this view visually display key metrics about the total number of 
decisions in your environment. For example, the tiles display information such as 
destination types, deployments to single destinations or to multiple destinations, and 
deployments with and without models.
TIP You can click  to hide the tiles.
The tabular view below the tiles displays details about each published decision in 
your environment. For example, details include information such as the decision 
name, the published destination, the published date, the number of nodes, and 310 Chapter 8 / Working with Decisions
