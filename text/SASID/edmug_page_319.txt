Validate a Published Decision
You can test the published decision in the publishing destination. When you publish 
the decision to any destination type except Git, a validation test is automatically 
defined for that decision in that destination.
Note: When both the SAS Intelligent Decisioning 
sas.decisions.masnode.removeTrailingUnderscoresFromInput  property and the 
SAS Micro Analytic Service service.removetrailingunderscoresfrominputs  property 
are set to On, publishing validation tests will fail for content that has been published 
to a SAS Micro Analytic Service destination.
