Working with Data Grids in SAS Studio
When you are using data grids in a DS2 custom code file in SAS Intelligent 
Decisioning , the data grid package and the data grid functions are predefined. 
However, these packages and functions are not automatically available when you 
are using SAS Studio to develop and test code. You can use the 
%DCM_DATAGRID_INTERFACE macro to make data grid functionality available in 
SAS Studio. For more information, see “%DCM_DATAGRID_INTERFACE Macro” 
on page 16.
In addition, if your test thread or data program uses any data grid functions, then 
you need to invoke %DCM_DATAGRID_INTERFACE within the thread or data 
block, after any global declaration statements. For example:data work.cars;    set sashelp.cars; run;%dcm_serializegrid(gridSourceTable=work.cars,                   classVars=make,                   outputTable=work.carsByMakeGrid,                   gridColName=carsGrid)proc ds2;   /* define data grid DS2 packages */      package "testCustomCode" /inline;      /* define data grid interface methods */      %dcm_datagrid_interface()      method execute(varchar(32) whichColumn,         in_out double meanValue,         in_out package datagrid thisGrid);         meanValue = DataGrid_Mean(thisGrid,whichColumn);      end;   endpackage;   data work.profileByMake(keep=(rowCount make meanMSRP meanWeight carsGrid))                            / overwrite=yes;      dcl package testCustomCode myCustomCode();      dcl double meanMSRP;      dcl double meanWeight;      dcl varchar(32767) carsGrid;  /* serialize in and out */      dcl package datagrid _carsGrid ();      dcl integer rowCount;      /* define data grid interface methods */      %dcm_datagrid_interface()      method run();         set work.carsByMakeGrid;         meanMSRP = .;           meanWeight = .;         rowCount = DataGrid_Create(_carsGrid,carsGrid);
