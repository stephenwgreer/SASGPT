Checking Out and Committing Decision 
Versions
About Checking Out and Committing Versions
Your administrator can enable the check-out and commit feature for decisions that 
are in any folder by specifying the folder in the 
sas.decisions.checkout.checkoutEnabledFolderPaths configuration option. Enabling 
this feature for a folder does not automatically modify the permissions for the folder 
or for the objects in it. You can still modify a decision in the folder without checking it 
out, but you are expected to check out the latest version before you edit it. However, 
your administrator might also set permissions that require you to check out 
decisions in these folders before you can edit them. For more information, see 
“sas.decisions.checkout” in SAS Intelligent Decisioning: Administrator’s Guide  and 
“Set Permissions for Check-Out Folders” in SAS Intelligent Decisioning: 
Administrator’s Guide .
By default, SAS Intelligent Decisioning  defines a folder where you can store 
decisions that must be checked out before they can be edited by users without 
administrator privileges. This folder is the Decision Repository
 folder, and it is the 
default value for the sas.decisions.checkout.checkoutEnabledFolderPaths 
configuration option. The default permissions for this folder require that non-
administrative users check out a version and commit their changes to the checked-
out version. Users who do not have administrative permissions cannot edit the 
decisions in Decision Repository
 without first checking them out.
Note: The sas.decisions.checkoutEnabledFolderPaths option controls the check-
out and commit feature for both decisions and code files. The check out and commit 
feature for lookup tables, treatments and treatment groups, and rule sets are 
controlled by configuration options that are specific to those object types.
If a version can be or must be checked out before it is modified, the Check Out 
button appears at the top of the Versions  tab for that object. You can check out any 
version of an object. You can check out only one copy of a version at a time.
TIP If the sas.decisions.checkout.allowConcurrentCheckout option is turned 
off, and a user has checked out a decision version, the Check Out  button for 
that decision is disabled for all other users. For more information, see 
“Concurrently Checking Out and Committing Decision Versions” on page 274.
When you check out a version, SAS Intelligent Decisioning  writes a working copy of 
the version into your My Folder
 folder and opens the working copy. SAS Intelligent 
Decisioning  adds “(Checked Out)
” to the name that is displayed at the top of the 
window.272 Chapter 8 / Working with Decisions
