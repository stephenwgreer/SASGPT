IMPORTANT A delay of up to one minute can occur between the time when 
you define or modify (replace) a function and the time at which the function is 
available to be executed.
When SAS Intelligent Decisioning  generates code, it inserts the custom function 
definition ahead of the code that it generates for the rule set logic or code file logic. 
In the rule set or code file, you can reference custom functions in the same way that 
you reference functions that are provided by SAS.
Note: You can nest custom function calls. For example, if A and B are custom 
functions and DIVIDE is the DS2 function provided by SAS, you can nest functions 
as follows:method B() returns double;     return 5; end;method A() returns double;    return DIVIDE(10,B());end;
Create a Custom Function
1In the Custom Functions category view, click New Custom Function . The New 
Custom Function  window appears.
2Enter a name for the function if you do not want to use the default name. The 
name cannot be the same as the name of an existing SAS function. Function 
names must be unique within an environment and are limited to 250 characters. 
Function names must be valid DS2 identifiers. For more information, see “DS2 
Identifiers” in SAS DS2 Programmer’s Guide .
3(Optional) Enter a description for the new function. Descriptions are limited to 
1000 characters.
TIP You can edit the description later on the Properties  tab.
4Select the category to which the function belongs. 
TIP Custom functions must be associated with a function category. A 
category named Category 1  is defined by default. You can change this 
category name, or create new a new category. For instructions about 
creating new categories, see “Create a Custom Function Category” on 
page 208.
