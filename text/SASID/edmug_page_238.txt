Managing the Variables in a Decision
About Variables
The Properties of a Variable
Note: For information about data grid variables, see “Using Data Grids in SAS 
Intelligent Decisioning” in SAS Intelligent Decisioning: Using Data Grids .PropertyDescriptionNameVariable names must start with a letter or an underscore (_), and they 
can contain only alphanumeric characters and the underscore. 
Variable names can be up to 32 characters long. They must be unique 
within a decision.
Note: SAS Intelligent Decisioning  does not support double-byte 
character set (DBCS) characters in variable names.
Note: Do not use any of these operators or keywords as variable 
names: AND, OR, IN, NOT, LIKE, TRUE, or FALSE. Do not use _N_ 
or any DS2 reserved word as a variable name. See “Reserved Words 
in the DS2 Language” in SAS DS2 Programmer’s Guide  for 
information about reserved words in the DS2 language.Data typeSAS Intelligent Decisioning  supports the following data types: 
Boolean, character, data grid, date, datetime, decimal, and integer. 
Binary and varying-length binary variables are supported only in 
decisions. Binary variables are supported only as input variables or 
temporary variables in order to support models that require binary 
data.
For Boolean variables, you can select True
 or False
 for the initial 
value. However, SAS Intelligent Decisioning  represents Boolean 222 Chapter 8 / Working with Decisions
