Optional Arguments
CLASSVARS= class_variable1 < class_variable2 ...>
specifies the class variables that control how the data is grouped into data grids. 
If you specify one class variable, the results table contains one data grid for each 
value of the class variable. If you specify more than one class variable, a 
separate data grid is created for each combination of values for the class 
variables. The class variables are written to the output results table.
GRIDCOLS= column1 < column2 ...>
specifies the names of the columns that are to be serialized into the data grid. If 
you do not specify this option, all of the columns in the table are serialized 
except for the columns specified by the CLASSVARS= option.
GRIDCOLLEN= length
specifies the length for the column specified by the GRIDCOLUMN= option. If 
the results table is a Base SAS table, the length must be less than or equal to 
32,767. If the results table is a SAS Cloud Analytic Services (CAS) table, the 
length must be less than or equal to 10,485,760.Default32,767
PROMOTE= YES | NO
promotes the merged data grid table from session scope to global scope.DefaultYESRestrictionThis option is valid only if the output table is written to a CAS library.
Example: Serializing the Assets Table
The following example serializes (creates JSON strings) the assets data for each 
customer in the mylib.assets table. The output table is named assetsGrid, and the 
data grid column in the output table is named Assets. The data in the mylib.assets 
table is grouped by the class variable custName, so the output table contains one 
row for each value of custName.%dcm_serializeGrid(      gridSourceTable=mylib.assets,      gridColName=Assets,       outputTable=assetsGrid,      classvars=custName);
