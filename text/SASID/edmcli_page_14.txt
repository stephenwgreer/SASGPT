Transfer Content from a SAS 9.4 Environment to a 
SAS Viya Environment
Note: See “Command-Line Interface: Preliminary Instructions” in SAS Viya: Using 
the Command-Line Interface  for additional information.
To transfer business rules and decision content from a SAS 9.4 environment to a 
SAS Viya environment:
1Log on to the machine where SAS Viya is running. For example, on Linux 
systems, you can use the ssh
 command:ssh -y machine-name
2Use the cd
 command to change to the directory where you downloaded the plug-
in files.
3Create a default profile if you have not already done so:sas-viya profile init
The CLI prompts you for the URL (service endpoint) for SAS Viya, for the output 
type that you want, and whether you want to enable color output. For more 
information, see “Create at Least One Profile” in SAS Viya: Using the Command-
Line Interface .
4Log on to the SAS Viya environment:sas-viya auth login
The CLI prompts you for the user ID and password for the SAS Viya 
environment.
5Log on to the SAS 9.4 environment:sas-viya dcmtransfer auth9x login
The CLI prompts you for the URL (service endpoint) for the SAS 9.4 environment 
and the user ID and password for that environment.
6Export the SAS 9.4 content:sas-viya dcmtransfer export9x object-type <export-options>
If you do not specify any options, the CLI prompts you for the required 
information.
By default, the export9x
 command creates three files:
contents.json
This file contains the exported content. Do not modify the contents of this file.
mappings.json
This file describes the relationships between the exported content and any 
associated objects. For example, if you export rule sets, the mapping file 
contains information about any lookup tables that are referenced in the rule 
sets and all folders where the rule sets and lookup tables reside. You can 
modify some of the data in this file before you import content into the SAS 10Chapter 2 / SAS Intelligent Decisioning CLIs
