By default, the Decision Flow  tab displays all of the nodes in each object and 
highlights the differences. Click Show Differences  to limit the display to only the 
nodes that are different in each object. Click Show All  to return to the default 
view.
For example, in the following figure, both version 1.0 and version 2.0 of the 
Evaluate_Loans decision contain the same rule sets, but the branches are 
different. Version 1.0 uses a Yes/No branch that is based on the value of the 
DEBTINC variable, and Version 2.0 uses an Equals branch that is based on the 
value of the BAD variable. In Version 1.0, the Low_Ratio rule set is in the Yes 
branch path, and in Version 2.0, the Low_Ratio rule set in the BAD=0 path.

3(Optional) Click the Decision  tab to display the contents of each object. In this 
view, the information icon 
  on Record contacts nodes displays which variables 
and treatments are being tracked, whether rule-fired data or path-tracking are 
turned on, and whether the contact record is included in aggregate reports. For 
other node types, this icon displays information about whether a node was 
added, deleted, moved to another position in the decision, or changed to use a 
different version of the node object. However, if the decision is large or complex 
and a node was moved a significant distance, SAS Intelligent Decisioning  might 
not be able to determine if the node was moved or deleted.256 Chapter 8 / Working with Decisions
