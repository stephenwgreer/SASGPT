Example
Suppose you have the decision flow Update_credit_history. Version 2 of this 
decision contains the following objects:
nVersion 2 of the rule set Select_accounts, which is not tagged. Version 1 of this 
rule set is tagged with APR_rules_chg, but this tag was added to the wrong 
version of this rule set. The tag should have been added to version 2 of the rule 
set.
nVersion 3 of the decision Calc_credit_chgs. Both version 3 and version 4 of this 
decision are tagged with APR_rules_chg.
nVersion 1 of the code file Update_history. This version is the only version of this 
code file and it is not tagged.
You need to create a new version of Update_credit_history that includes version 4 of 
the decision Calc_credit_chgs (the tagged version) and version 2 of the rule set 
Select_accounts (which is not tagged).
1On page 1 of the Create New Version wizard, specify the tag APR_rules_change 
and select the option Let me choose the version of each object .
