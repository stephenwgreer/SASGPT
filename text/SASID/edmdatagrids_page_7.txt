When Are Data Grid Columns Created?
At run time, data grid columns are automatically created for columns that already 
exist in the input table or that are generated by a treatment group or by a data query 
node. When you add a new column to the metadata for a data grid in the Edit 
Columns  window, you can choose whether the column is automatically created at 
run time. For all other data grid columns, you must use a data grid function to create 
the data grid column at run time. For more information, see Step 7  in “Add Columns 
to a Data Grid”  and “Data Grid Functions Available in SAS Intelligent Decisioning” 
on page 31.
Processing Data In A Data Grid
If you are processing the data grid column in the insurance policy table, you could 
define a variable named Policies of type DATAGRID and use the functions 
described in “Data Grid Functions” on page 29 to process the data.  For example:DATAGRID_GET(Policies, 'PolicyNumber', 2)
For policy holder Joe Smyth, this function call returns 987348P210
. In this case, you 
define variables for only the PolicyHolder and Policies columns. You do not define 
variables for the PolicyNumber and YearlyPremium columns within the data grid.
Alternatively, you can process the data grid column in the insurance policy table by 
using a rule set, a model, or a decision to process each row in the data grid. To 
specify that an object processes each row in a data grid, you select Score rows in 
this data grid  in the Properties  panel for the object. In this case, you do not use the 
data grid functions. You define decision variables for the individual columns in the 
data grid, such as PolicyNumber and YearlyPremium. For more information, see 
“Ways to Work with Data Grids” on page 5 and “Scoring Rows in a Data Grid” on
