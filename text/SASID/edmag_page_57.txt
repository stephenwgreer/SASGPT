Granting Access to Test Results
Granting Access to Tests That Are Created in SAS Intelligent 
Decisioning 5.3 or Later
When you create a new rule set test or decision test in SAS Intelligent Decisioning 5.3 or later, you 
can specify a folder in which the test definition and the test results are stored. For tests that are saved 
in folders, access is based on the permissions for the folders, the object types, or the specific objects 
as described in “Full Access and Service Endpoints” on page 54.
Note: You can control access to tests that are created in SAS Intelligent Decisioning 5.4 or later by 
using the SASScoreUsers group. However, it is recommended that you store test definitions and 
results in folders. The ability to store tests outside of folders and the use of the SASScoreUsers group 
for rule set and decision tests is supported for legacy purposes only.56
