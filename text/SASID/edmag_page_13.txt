sas.decisions.validation.validationCoreThreadPoolSize
Specifies the maximum number of threads that SAS Intelligent Decisioning  can use to validate 
decisions. If you routinely validate very large decisions, increasing the number of threads available 
to the validation process can improve performance.Default8
sas.decisions.variableLengthOverridden
Specifies whether you can override the default length for input-only and input-output character 
variables in decisions and code files. When this property is set to Off, the lengths for these 
variables are based on the length of the input columns to which the variables are mapped. When 
this property is set to On, SAS Intelligent Decisioning uses the lengths that you specify when you 
create the variables.DefaultOffSee“Managing the Variables in a Decision” in SAS Intelligent Decisioning: User’s Guide

sas.decisions.checkout.checkoutEnabledFolderPaths
Specifies the list of folder paths whose decisions and code files can be or must be checked out 
before they can be edited. Separate path names with commas.Default/Decision Repository

configuration option. You must explicitly set the permissions in order to require that the 
objects in the additional folders are checked out before they are modified. See “Set
