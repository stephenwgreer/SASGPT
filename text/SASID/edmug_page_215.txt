TIP  By default, the autocomplete feature is turned on for SAS functions 
and custom functions. You can turn off this feature or change what is 
displayed in the autocomplete list by using the SAS Intelligent Decisioning 
settings. You can specify that SAS Intelligent Decisioning also displays 
variable names. For information, see “SAS Intelligent Decisioning Settings” 
on page 8.
In the autocmplete list, SAS Intelligent Decisioning displays all function 
names and variable names that match the text that you enter. Double-click an 
item to add it to the code field. Single-click an item to display information 
about the item, such as whether it is a function or a variable. For functions, 
the information includes the returned data type and category. For variables, 
the information includes the data type and direction (input, output, or both).
The autocomplete list does not include functions that are defined in a custom 
context file.
Rules for Writing Custom Function Files
When you are developing your DS2 custom function, follow these rules:
nDo not change the name of the method. The method name must match the 
function name.
nThe method signature can include variables that are both input and output 
variables. Specify these variables with the in_out
 keyword. Custom functions 
support data grid packages and the DS2 data types that are listed in “Data Types 
for SAS Data Sets” in SAS DS2 Language Reference .
In the method signature, list input-only parameters first. List input-output and 
output-only parameters next, using the in_out modifier. Do not specify a length 
for input-output and output-only parameters. The length for these parameters is 
derived from the variables that are passed into the method.
Note: Packages are input-output data types.
nThe variables that you use as function parameters must be mapped to input 
variables in your decision.Rules for Writing Custom Function Files 201
