Milestones  
Model Execution Proposal Page 10  
To make the decision on the model execution platform, FCB wants to ensure the proposed SAS 
solution is feasible with FCB’s technical and functional requirements.  Following are the success 
criteria for a successful Phase 0 . 
♦ Systematic workflow controls with a formal approval process  
♦ Model execution version history  maintained across various executions  
♦ Loss model execution with the ability to iterate and run additional scenarios  
♦ Ability to upload and/or create new scenarios to run while maintaining a scenario library  
♦ User playpen -type functionality t o address ad -hoc model execution request s 
♦ Post model analytical tasks such as what -if/sensitivity analysis, slice/dice of the results, and 
creation of the ad -hoc reports  
 
SAS will provide the Phase 0  environment and implement the Credit Card Portfolio to 
demonstrate the technical and functional richness that will address FCB’s need. The high -level

5 Implement Models and Configure Solution          
6 Interactive Phase 0 Review & Delivery (FCB)          
7 Pilot Decision          
 
At  the end of the Phase 0  decision, SAS will continue to work with FCB on demonstrating the 
vision towards integrated balance sheet management by incorporating the interest income 
calculation.  
 
The following assumptions are considered in Phase 0 : 
♦ The SAS platform will be installed a nd configured in SAS’ Lab environment  
♦ FCB to walk  through the data and model logic in detail  
♦ FCB to provide clean and reconciled data in the landing area  
♦ FCB will provide the list of authorized users with  their  IP address  to grant access to the Phase 
0 environment  
 
Milestone 2: Setting up the FCB Environment in SAS Cloud  
♦ Create development and production environment s in the SAS Cloud  
♦ Establish connectivity with the FCB infrastructure  
♦ Migrate the Credit Card Model from Phase 0  to the FCB environment
