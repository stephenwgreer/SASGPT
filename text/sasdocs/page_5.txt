Executive Summary  
Model Execution Proposal Page 2 FCB is looking for a model execution solution in preparation  for the CCAR 2024 production cycle.

heavily regulated industry and provides expansion cap abilities to support multiple lines of

♦ Milestone  2:  Set up the FCB environment  in SAS Cloud  
♦ Milestone  3:  Establish an end -to-end process for one portfolio

the infrastructure towards the incorporation of CECL and an integrated balance sheet 
management  solution .
