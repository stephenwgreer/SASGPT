Model Execution Proposal Page 5 SAS® Viya ® Model Execution  Solution  
The SAS Viya Model Execution Solution  provides an end -to-end, fully integrated model execution 
environment to accelerate the analysis and processes across risk, treasury, and finance 
departments. The solution utilizes the high -performance capabilities of the SAS Viya platform to 
provide the risk specific functionality needed to support multi -functional, process -intensive, and 
detail -oriented activi ties required to support CCAR, CECL , and Integrated Balance Sheet 
Management processes.  
 
 
The main components involved in the end -to-end process are:  
♦ Data Management, Data Quality a nd Overrides  
♦ Assumptions and Scenario Design  
♦ Execution Engine and Simulation Environment  
♦ Orchestration and Risk Consolidation  
♦ Dynamic Reporting  
♦ Technology  
 
Data Management, Data Quality and Overrides  
The solution  leverages the powerful data management capabilities of SAS Viya interacting with all 
relevant sources (both internal and external).  The solution provides the data lineage to track how 
data moves through the process and undergoes different transformations.  The solution creates 
snapshots of the data inputs and results from model execution to support auditability of data.   
 The solution automates and deploys business rules created and managed by business users. 
Furthermore, users can add advanced data managem ent capabilities if required for data profiling, 
data quality, data cleansing, etc. to manage noisy, inconsistent, and incomplete data.
